# Installation Instructions

This project was primarily developed using [Michigan State Universityâ€™s High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC)](https://icer.msu.edu/) . The following instructions outline how to reproduce the full workflow on the HPCC, including database setup, data collection, machine learning modeling, and visualization of results through model embeddings.

The project is located within the /mnt/research/TwoSix directory on the HPCC. Please ensure you are working within a space that provides sufficient storage capacity to accommodate the scraped data, MongoDB database, and trained models.

To begin, connect to the HPCC via [SSH](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Connect_to_HPCC_System/), and follow the steps below for a complete setup and execution pipeline.
