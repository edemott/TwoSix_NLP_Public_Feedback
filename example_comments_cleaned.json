    "comment": "My name is Linda Karr.I have been a near neighbor of two residential wood burners (RW B\u2019s) for 17 years in Madison, Wisconsin. I founded Residents against Wood Smoke Emission Particulates (RAWSEP) website in 2007-2014. and RAWSEP Residents in April 2022. On 9/15/2022 the European Union stopping paying subsidies for Industrial Wood Burning (I W B). Subsidies for Drax, the 2nd largest I W B in the World, are being reconsidered by the United Kingdom. PM2.5 monitors were handed out free to disadvantaged residents in Spring 2022 as pollution from R W B has surpassed traffic as % of PM2.5 in the London, England area since 2019. An Alaska pilot project will hand out PM 2.5 monitors to disadvantaged residents to track residential wood burning. I helped pass dozens of Outdoor Wood Boiler (O W B) ordinances across Wisconsin in 2011. After an O W B ordinance passed in Madison the Health Department inspected my wood burning neighbors\u2019 property and found 3 wood stoves. At http://www.rawsepresidents.org, since 4/20/2022, I represent the news and views of near neighbors of R W B\u2019s in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Europe, Africa and Asia.

A 10/14/2022, letter from 3 Republican U S House members to EPA head Michael Regan asked that E P A retain existing standards of 12 ug/m3. I favor changes. Particulate matter of 2.5 micrometer size, PM2.5, is the perfect size to infiltrate the human lung, causing a cascade of human health problems. R W B consists of 90% PM2.5. RAWSEP residents are near neighbors of R W B\u2019s, whose yards and homes are infiltrated with indoor R W B smoke from stacks of wood stoves. 1 MACRO POLLUTION MEASUREMENT IS FLAWED. The Republicans argue that PM2.5 emissions will reduce without changes of the PM2.5 standard from 12 to 8. RAWSEP argues that PM2.5 emissions are now measured at a flawed, macro level, and could be measured more accurately, in a hyper-localized way in the case of R W B, with PurpleAir PM2.5 monitors that measure levels every 10 minutes and are so reliable and accurate they are used on U S AirNow Fire and Smoke maps, correlated using a simple mathematical formula because they are laser counters, alongside reference E P A monitors costing $100,000. PurpleAir PM2.5 monitors cost under $300 and should be distributed free to residents to allow them to know the true level of PM2.5 hyper-localized. 2 ECONOMIES BASED ON POLLUTION SHOULD NOT CONTINUE. The Republicans argue that lowering PM2.5 emissions will destroy local economies. RAWSEP argues that present businesses should change to future clean businesses. 3 INCONSISTENCY is expected BETWEEN BIDEN AND TRUMP Administrations. The Republicans argue that in December 2020 the E P A chose not to consider lowering PM2.5 standards. Then, the Republicans argue, in June 2021 the E P A chose to consider lowering the PM2.5 standard. The Republicans argue that this reduces certainty of what the rules will be. RAWSEP\u2019s rebuttal is that there was a change in Administration between December 2020 and June 2021. The Trump administration was known for flouting environmental protections, and the Biden administration is known for fighting climate change and fighting air pollution. 4 REGULATION CAN BE ECONOMICAL, AND STILL GET RESULTS. Republicans argue that regulation of PM2.5 costs money. RAWSEP counters that by distributing PurpleAir PM2.5 monitors, evidence of PM2.5 pollution can be gathered 24 hours per day, every 10 minutes, and displayed on both the U S AirNow and on the PurpleAir map. Hyper-localized PM2.5 data is stored for years on the PurpleAir map, accessible to the general public and to governmental authorities. Costs would be less than $300 to each resident, or a less than $300 subsidy to disadvantaged residents vulnerable to polluting biomass industries or R W B neighbors, and for internet service which many residents will have, with expansion of broadband. Health departments will not have to inspect inside R W B\u2019s houses or determine if residents are using certified wood stoves or not, to know the level of PM2.5 emissions from a R WB\u2019s stack, measured at the fenceline on the property of near neighbors with the neighbor\u2019s own PM2.5 monitor. PM2.5 data can be downloaded by government authorities during normal working hours, after a night or weekend of wood burning and after its PM2.5 levels have been reported by a near neighbor. There is already a human health cost to the near neighbors of R W B\u2019s, if R W B is allowed to continue. 5 THE W H O IS 5 ug/m3 Indian Reservations have not been afforded air protections that have been provided to others in the U S.",

    "comment": "We are a manufacturer of EPA certified wood stoves; and have been since before EPA\u2019s initial wood emissions standards were promulgated over 30 years ago. As wood related environmental regulations have evolved over the years we have responded - by developing new technologies and appliances that have exceeded every new challenge as it came along. The foundation of our company is engineering. Our R & D department is staffed with some of the most highly qualified, experienced, and innovative technicians and engineers in the industry. You do not need to take our word for that, feel free to ask people at the EPA, the HPBA, the safety and emissions labs, even people in the know at NESCAUM. We know our stuff. It turns out that Alaska\u2019s new requirements will most likely benefit our company financially. From what will turn out to be a very short list of qualifying appliances we already build three excellent units. Please bear that in mind when you consider our comments below. We recognize that Fairbanks is a serious non-attainment area and ADEC is obligated to present a mitigation plan to the EPA. That is their justification for the new requirement that the first hour filter catch must not exceed 6 grams. We have no doubt that Alaska is genuinely attempting to use this requirement to ensure that only the very best performing appliances will be installed. We do not however believe the requirement makes much technical sense and, for the following reasons, are doubtful it will be even minimally effective at achieving the intended result: Simply put a certification test is conducted by burning a rigidly prescribed wood load in the stove in a rigidly prescribed manner on a test stand which continuously weighs the wood load as it burns. At the same time samples of the stove\u2019s emissions are collected on filters. When a test is completed the filters are weighed which enables the calculation of the emissions in, grams/hour, over the entire test. The test is then repeated at a variety of burn rates with corresponding emissions calculated for each test. These tests are then averaged to determine the stove\u2019s official emissions, in grams/hour. This seems simple enough, but different stoves burn, not surprisingly, differently. Some stoves start more quickly than others, some burn longer than others, some burn cleanest when burned more quickly, some when burned more slowly. And so on. In the end the testing process does a simple thing. It measures the total amount of emissions produced by the stove over a burn cycle, from start to finish, at a variety of specified burn rates. Anybody who has ever burned a woodstove knows that a stove takes some time to heat up and burn well so absolutely nobody will be surprised that emissions tend to be worst in the first hour. The Step2 Standard approximates how stoves get operated in a home. Nobody lights stove and burns it for just one hour, it is practically impossible to do so in a home. So, if two different stoves produce the same total emissions over the course of a day (meaning one produced more emissions in the first hour but less later) their contribution to the airshed will be the same. Which is what is wrong with Fairbanks\u2019 arbitrarily selected 6 gram of emissions over the first hour requirement. It does nothing to improve air quality and is simply not a relevant selection criterion for determining a \u201cbetter\u201d appliance. The current list of EPA Step2 certified appliances is already short. These certified products are the cleanest burning stoves ever produced in commercial quantities and represent the best commercially viable appliances our industry can offer at this time. The differences between them from an air quality standpoint, are not significant. We do not believe that any further whittling down of the list is necessary or justified. Further comments regarding Alaska\u2019s decision not to accept stoves tested to the ASTM cordwood standard, even though they are currently accepted by the EPA: Everyone agrees that testing stoves with cordwood more accurately reflects real world operation and should become the default emissions testing protocol. Unfortunately developing a test standard which effectively measures the emissions from a stove burning cordwood is a complex process. Standards development is almost always long and difficult, this one more than most. After having participated in the ASTM process and conducted considerable internal R & D we are confident that it is a very credible test as it stands. It is different than the current NSPS, but not easier to pass. It produces consistent and reliable emissions values. Although we are confident that our newest stove would pass the current NSPS we have chosen to certify it to the ASTM cordwood Standard. Our certification choice will help move the bar forward towards better testing down road as more data, and criticism, accumulates. Rejecting the process out of hand does the opposite.",

    "comment": "March 20, 2021 Comments to the Environmental Protection Agency on the Alaska State Implementation Plan for the Fairbanks North Star Borough Area: Kozy Heat Fireplaces is a manufacturer of wood burning appliances. Kozy Heat has dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to create NSPS 2020 compliant appliances in the belief that the federal standards represent proven test methods. We will provide comments on the measures which the EPA is proposing to approve regarding the Alaska State Implementation Plan for the Fairbanks North Star Borough Area (\u201cFairbanks SIP\u201d). We do recognize that the City of Fairbanks is an area of special considerations for air quality yet we view some of the measures taken by the State of Alaska to be based upon flawed logic. We believe the EPA\u2019s proposed approval to the Fairbanks SIP has several deficiencies that need to be removed before approval. Kozy Heat believes the additional provisions related to wood heat contained in 18 AAC \u00a7 50.077 that are a part of the Fairbanks SIP: - Overwrite the current EPA regulatory limits for woodstoves by creating new limits on emissions - that apply during shorter time periods based on existing testing methodology. Impose new and greater cost for certification that has not been quantified by either ADEC or the EPA. - Rely on unique testing equipment and methods that ADEC admits are \u201cnew\u201d and have not been incorporated into the federal test procedures. - Rely on testing equipment that almost all certified testing laboratories do not own, cannot get equipment to work or are not able to create replicable test results. - Are unsupported by technical information in the public docket - Rely on guidance developed by a third-party organization that is not addressed by ADEC or EPA. This guidance is not available in the public docket either. - Will decrease options available to consumers and disproportionality harm low-income households. When reviewing the proposed Fairbanks SIP Kozy Heat has major concerns with the testing provisions requiring TEOM testing equipment, 6.0 g/hr. one-hour filter pull limits and rolling 60-minute emissions limit requirements. When reviewing the proposed language one of the testing requirements incorporated is to make emission concentration measurements \u201cafter September 1, 2020, with either a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) or 1-hour filter data from EPA certification report for the device.\u201d Kozy Heat views both of these proposed requirements as flawed in their own aspects. We believe there are several reasons that the TEOM requirement is flawed logic. The first reason is ADEC admits TEOM equipment is new for wood stove emissions testing. The second reason is test laboratories we have been in communication with have no experience or guidelines with this equipment. The few laboratories that have had their hands on this equipment were not able to get the equipment and software to communicate and function correctly thus not being able to record data. The third reason is that this equipment has not been tested or incorporated into the federal certification process. The EPA lacks sufficient information to approve the use of TEOM data. The forth reason is that according to the proposal \u201cthe TEOM data must be obtained following the procedures set out in the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) Standard Operating Procedures for use of Thermo 1405 TEOM for use in a dilution tunnel using option 2 in section 6 and excluding Section 7, as revised May 17, 2019, and adopted by reference.\u201d The guidance by a third-party organization which is not previously addressed by ADEC or the EPA should not be accepted. The last reason is evidence outside the hearth industry where TEOM testing has shown sufficient variances in testing. - In \u201cAtmospheric Environment\u201d Volume 40, Issue 29, David Green and Gary Fuller use a TEOM instrument \u201cconfigured with a correction factor required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to account for the difference between the TEOM and the gravimetric Method. However, numerous studies have shown that this factor does not fully account for these differences, consequently, the European Commission (EC) insists on an independent assessment of the differences\u2026When compared to ambient reporting conditions, the TEOM standard temperature and pressure correction was found to contribute between \u22121 and 7 \u03bcg m\u22123 to the daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, and 2 \u03bcg m\u22123 to the annual mean concentrations. The standard temperature and pressure correction was also demonstrated to vary the annual mean concentration measured using the TEOM by 2\u20138% between European capital cities, with higher values in colder northern cities.\u201d - According to Li QF, Wang-Li L, Liu Z, Heber AJ. \u201cTEOM gave significantly lower values of both PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentrations.\u201d The information is referenced in: Field evaluation of particulate matter measurements using tapered element oscillating microbalance in a layer house. J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2012 Mar;62(3):322-35. doi: 10.1080/10473289.2011.650316. PMID: 22482290. The next requirement Kozy Heat will comment on is the 6.0 g/hr. one-hour filter pull limits. The proposed Fairbanks SIP lists \u201cTEOM measurement in wood stove testing is new and has not been incorporated into the federal certification procedures. Therefore, as an alternative to using the TEOM, DEC will allow the use of the valid 1-hour filter measurement from the EPA certification tests. The maximum 1-hr filter measurement may not exceed 6 grams/hour.\u201d With ADEC acknowledging TEOM is a new and unproven method to perform emissions testing they then added the 1-hour filter pull option. The addition of the 6.0 g/hr. one-hour filter pull limit is another form of regulation to override federal testing requirements. ADEC states that they will use the data to \u201cgauge performance and determine which appliances are low emitting from the start of the certification versus those that have been able to design for long charcoal tails to minimize the peak emissions.\u201d ADEC received many comments in the public comment period they held yet their responses provided no information to validate the use of a TEOM in emissions testing or what effect on real-world emissions it is expected to have. There is total silence on real-world use of wood heating appliances as a reason why the 6.0 g/hr. filter pull limit is valid. Homeowners do not let their fireplace go out and get completely cold. The Alaska artic winters are extremely cold and homeowners keep their stove running at all times. It is in their interest to keep the fireplace operating at the most efficient point of the burn so the homeowner can get the most heat out of the appliance as possible. Another reason it is in the homeowner\u2019s best interest to keep the stove running at all times and in the most efficient manner is cost of operation and ownership. Other forms of heat such as liquid propane, Natural gas, electric or fuel oil are all more expensive than wood heat. These tie into the last requirement Kozy Heat will comment on which is the rolling 60-minute emissions limit requirements. One-hour data represents a snapshot of emissions. That data does not reflective the ability of a stove to be factored correctly into a 24-hour emission limit as established by the EPA for the PM2.5 NAAQS. Neither ADEC nor the EPA has provided data that connects the one-hour limit to attainment of a 24-hour concentration. As previously mentioned wood stoves in real-world operation would have multiple hours at relatively minimal emissions rates. In conclusion Kozy Heat Fireplaces believes the testing provisions requiring TEOM testing equipment, 6.0 g/hr. one-hour filter pull limits, rolling 60-minute emissions limit requirements and use of guidance from third-party organizations, such as NESCAUM, to be removed and/or not considered for Alaska State Implementation Plan for the Fairbanks North Star Borough Area.

Box 3598 Boulder, CO 80305 http://airlaw4all.com January 6, 2022 Mr. Jeff Hunt EPA Region 10 1200 Sixth Avenue\u2014Suite 155 Seattle, WA 98101 Re: Docket ID No. EPA\u2013R10\u2013OAR\u20132021\u20130751 Dear Mr. Hunt: On behalf of the Center for Biological Diversity, Air Law for All, Ltd. submits the following comments to Docket No. EPA\u2013R10\u2013OAR\u20132021\u20130751 regarding EPA\u2019s proposed action, \u201cAir Plan Approval; Washington; Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency, General Air Quality Regulations,\u201d 86 FR 69200 (Dec. 7, 2021). I. INTRODUCTION The Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s mission is to ensure the preservation, protection, and restoration of biodiversity, native species, ecosystems, public lands and waters, and public health through science, policy, and environmental law. Based on the understanding that the health and vigor of human societies and the integrity and wildness of the natural environment are closely linked, the Center for Biological Diversity is working to secure a future for animals and plants hovering on the brink of extinction, for the ecosystems they need to survive, and for a healthy, livable future for all of us. EMISSION DATA, AS DEFINED BY EPA, AND OTHER DATA USED IN II. PREPARATION OF PLANS MUST BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE EPA proposes to approve Section 1.06, Records, of Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency Regulation 1.1 Section 1.06.D treats as confidential records \u201cany information, other than ambient air quality data or emission data,\u201d that is certified by an owner or operator as meeting certain requirements, subject to review by the Agency.2 Appendix A to 1 86 FR at 69201. 2 Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency, Regulation 1 \u00a7 1.06.D. Regulation 1 does not contain a definition of \u201cemission data\u201d;3 nor do the general provisions of the Washington Administrative Code4 (which is applicable in the absence of a specific provision of Regulation 1).5 Furthermore, section 173-400-175 of the Washington Administrative Code provides: All information, except information protected from disclosure under any applicable law, including, but not limited to, RCW 70.94.205, is available for public inspection at the issuing agency.6 The breadth of the exception creates the possibility that an \u201capplicable law\u201d (including Regulation 1) will exempt more information from public scrutiny than is permissible under the Act. In other words, the broader the disclosure protection under some applicable law, the broader the exemption. This problem is exacerbated by the absence of an approved definition of \u201cemission data.\u201d Under EPA\u2019s regulations for state implementation plans (SIPs) in Part 51, \u201call detailed data and calculations used in the preparation of each plan or each plan revision\u201d must be made publicly available.7 Furthermore, all \u201cemission data reported by source owners or operators or otherwise obtained by a State or local agency\u201d must be made publicly available.8 \u201cEmission data\u201d is not defined in Part 51; instead, it is defined for purposes of EPA\u2019s determinations of confidential business information (CBI) in Part 2.9 The definition is broad and not restricted merely to the quantity of emissions from a stack, a narrow interpretation that must be avoided. As EPA explained when proposing its definition of \u201cemission data,\u201d the term is not defined under the Act.10 EPA noted, for example, that section 114(c) of the Act requires public availability of information EPA collects, subject to a confidentiality exception, which in turn cannot apply to \u201cemission data.\u201d11 Furthermore, the information cannot be confidential if it is \u201crelevant to any proceeding\u201d under the Act.12 EPA reasoned that the term \u201cproceeding\u201d is not defined and therefore includes any rulemaking, adjudication, or licensing.13 Thus, EPA\u2019s definition of \u201cemission data\u201d is informed by the potential for its relevance to proceedings under the Act. There is no rational reason, and EPA proposes none, why the interpretation of \u201cemission data\u201d in EPA\u2019s part 51 regulations should vary from EPA\u2019s definition in Part 2. Thus, the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency must confirm that it will apply section 1.06 consistently with EPA\u2019s definition. 3 Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency, Regulation 1, App\u2019x A. 4 WAC \u00a7 173-400-030. 5 Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency, Regulation 1 \u00a7 1.04.A. 6 WAC \u00a7 173-400-175. 7 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.116(a). 8 Id. \u00a7 51.116(b). 9 Id. \u00a7 2.301(a)(2)(i). 10 86 FR 21987, 21990 (May 20, 1975). 11 Id. 12 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(c). 13 86 FR at 21990. 2 In addition, Regulation 1 cannot exempt information that is \u201cused in the preparation of each plan or plan revision.\u201d One example could be identification of a manufacturing process that is used to estimate emissions from the facility for purposes of an attainment plan. Even if the facility claims the identification of the manufacturing process is confidential, it is used in preparation of the plan and must be disclosed to the public. This information would also fall under EPA\u2019s definition of \u201cemission data,\u201d which includes: [I]nformation necessary to determine the identity, amount, frequency, concentration, or other characteristics (to the extent related to air quality) of any emission which has been emitted by the source (or of any pollutant resulting from any emission by the source), or any combination of the foregoing;14 This confirms that EPA must require the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency to employ a broad interpretation of \u201cemission data\u201d consistent with EPA\u2019s. III. EPA MUST FULLY DISCLOSE THE LEGAL EFFECTS OF ITS APPROVAL OF SECTION 4.03, VOLUNTARY LIMITS ON EMISSIONS EPA proposes to approve Section 4.03, Voluntary Limits on Emissions, of Yakima Regional Air Agency Regulation 1.15 Section 4.03.A provides: Upon request by the owner or operator of a new or existing source or stationary source, the agency shall issue a regulatory order that limits the potential to emit any air contaminant or contaminants to a level agreed to by the owner or operator and the agency.16 EPA does not state, however, whether such \u201cregulatory orders\u201d can be enforced by EPA under section 113 of the Act or by citizens under section 304 of the Act. Section 4.03 is not part of an approved new source review (NSR) program, so the legal effect of orders issued under it is not immediately apparent. EPA is obliged not only to determine whether a SIP submission meets the requirements of the Act, but also to give notice to regulated parties and the public of the legal effects of its approval. Failure to do so is not just bad government, it also evades a key purpose of public notice for informal rulemakings under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).17 Section 113(a)(3) provides that EPA can issue an administrative enforcement order for violations of, among other things, any \u201corder\u201d issued under the Act.18 Similarly, EPA can bring an action in federal district court for violations of any \u201corder\u201d issued under the Act.19 Thus, it appears that EPA can enforce these \u201cregulatory orders,\u201d but EPA must confirm this in its final action. 14 Id. \u00a7 2.301(a)(2)(i)(A). 15 86 FR at 69202. 16 Yakima Regional Air Agency, Regulation 1 \u00a7 4.03.A 17 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553; see also Buckeye Power v. EPA, 481 F.2d 162 (6th Cir. 1973) (holding SIP approvals are rulemakings within the meaning of the APA and therefore subject to notice-and-comment requirements). 18 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(a)(3). 19 Id. \u00a7 7413(b)(2). 3 Section 304(a) provides for citizen suits for violations of any \u201cemission standard or limitation.\u201d20 For purposes of section 304, the phrase \u201cemission standard or limitation\u201d is given a detailed definition in section 304(f). While this definition does not include the same term \u201corder\u201d as in section 113(a)(3), it includes any \u201cemission standard,\u201d as well as any \u201cother standard \u2026 established \u2026 under any applicable State implementation plan approved by the Administrator.\u201d21 \u201cEmission standard\u201d is defined in section 302(k) to include \u201ca requirement established by the State \u2026 which limits the quantity, rate, or concentration of emissions of air pollutants on a continuous basis.\u201d The limit provided for in section 4.03.A appears to meet the plain language of this definition, but if not, then the limit falls under the \u201cother standard established under a SIP\u201d provision. In addition, section 304(a)(1)(B) encompasses any \u201corder issued \u2026 by a State with respect to such standard or limitation.\u201d Thus, it appears that citizens can enforce these \u201cregulatory orders\u201d under section 304, but EPA must confirm this in its final action.

Congratulations on the revisions/amendments to AFCARS regulations. This has clearly been a major effort, resulting in excellent and much needed changes. I only have two comments: P. 2084 \u2013 Section on Capturing Greater Detail (1 mention of displacements) P. 2094 \u2013 Sections on Prior Adoption, Prior Adoption Type, and Prior Adoption Location: The use of \u201cdisplaced adoptions\u201d and \u201cdisplacement \u201c (there are 4 such mentions on this page) \u2013 this wording can be considered outdated. A more recent and less value-laden term is to refer to post adoption placement, which can be referred to as PAP. I very much hope that post adoption placement will substitute for all references to displacement/displaced in the final version of the regulations. P. 2096 \u2013 Section on Termination of Parental Rights: Some localities (New York City is an example) there are 2 different dates for a tpr \u2013 1) the date that a judge signs the order; 2) the date that is officially recorded. It would be important to indicate which date is wanted so that there is agreement among state reports. Thank you so much.

The topic areas represent excellent expansion of the variables studied. This new data represent a giant step forward in collecting data that will lead to a better understanding of issues for children adopted from the public system. The data generated will have implications for policy and practice and will be of interest to policy makers, administrators and researchers. Thank you for your leadership. Following are some issues for you to consider. First, for child information, surely we are at the stage to collect diagnostic information on children. It is very different if they have a mood disorder (anxiety/depression) compared to conduct disorder compared to serious and persistent mental illness (for example, schizophrenia). It is not that I think we need to medicalize child welfare but having agencies get this information will give adoptive parents and professionals better information. The list you have does not give enough information. Child welfare workers will have a psychiatric/psychological report to get diagnosis. Also, where are data about developmental delays, which are not the same as development disabilities. This is particularly important for children under 5. Since all children under 5 are supposed to be evaluated from Help Me Grow, developmental delays will known to each caseworker. You might also want to just record whether a developmental evaluation was conducted. Two, where is the abuse and neglect info? It is possible to know the age of first confirmed abuse by type of abuse, severity of abuse, how long they suffered abuse/neglect, and perpetrator. Some of this is in the record but the records don't give us enough detail. A child who gets severely abused at age 2 will have different adoption outcomes then children whose first incident was at 6, for example. Three, we need more birth parent data. Age DAD had the child, age both parents or either parent come to attention of the system, whether MOM or DAD were graduates of the system, education level of both parents, race/ethnicity, whether they have or had other children in the system, and status of their other children. Four, for out-of-home care, is kinship care the same as relative foster care? Isn't there a difference when a kin becomes a foster parent compared to a kin who just cares for the child compared to kin who are unwilling or unable to get licensed as a foster care provider. Five, for those children were were initially placed in international adoption, can you record the country of origin? Six, for prenatal drug exposure, can you record the type of drug? Can you record one versus multiple drug exposure. Seven, has the TPR been appealed or is it under appeal? Eight, what about whether the child is a citizen? Thanks for your consideration.

I am very pleased to see that the Administration for Children and Families is moving forward with implementing important changes to gather richer information about the experiences of children in out of home care. Voice for Adoption (VFA) is a membership advocacy organization. We speak out for the 114,000 children in foster care who are waiting to be adopted. VFA members recruit families to adopt special needs children and youth. Our members also provide vital support services both before and after adoption finalization to help adoptive families through the challenges they often face. We are dedicated to finding permanent, loving families for every waiting child in foster care. We are also concerned about those youth in foster care who do not find permanent families but instead age out without family connections. The proposed changes to AFCARS reflect a strong understanding of the gaps that currently exist in the AFCARS data as well as the need for more detail about how children in the child welfare system are being served. I commend the Children\u2019s Bureau on making such valuable revisions to the key child welfare data system. Specifically, I want to highlight good components of the proposed changes to AFCARS that I believe are particularly important to retain in the final regulations: \u00b7 1355.40(c)\u2014The broader scope of the reporting population to include all children in out of home care for whom the State agency is responsible is a positive change that will better reflect the total population of children in the child welfare system. P.O. Box 2685 Washington, DC 20013 202-210-8118 | voiceforadoption@gmail.com www.voice-for-adoption.org Page 2 \u2013 Voice for Adoption comments\u2014AFCARS \u00b7 1355.41(b)\u2014Including children in subsidized guardianship arrangements will provide helpful new data about the number of children who are supported by this key permanency option. \u00b7 1355.43(b)(10)\u2014Gathering greater detail about a child\u2019s prior adoption and disruptions will provide critical information to the child welfare field about the stability of adoptions from foster care. \u00b7 1355.43(a) Child record number\u2014The longitudinal approach of these proposed regulations, specifically the use of a unique child record number, will meet a long-standing need for data about a child\u2019s total experience in out of home care, rather than a single episode. \u00b7 1355.44(c)(1) and (3)\u2014Gathering detailed information about adoption assistance (including non-recurring expenses and whether the subsidy is state-only or Title IV-E support) will provide a more accurate picture of the way adoption assistance programs are supporting adoptions from foster care. \u00b7 1355.43(b)(11)\u2014Gathering more detailed information about siblings and sibling groups in placements together is important in order to truly understand how well the child welfare system is doing in meeting the goal of keeping siblings together in out-of-home care. \u00b7 1355.43(b)\u2014The stronger emphasis on gathering data about child well-being makes important steps toward providing a meaningful profile of the well-being of children in the child welfare system. \u00b7 1355.43(e)(4) Other living arrangement type\u2014The proposal to distinguish among varying kinds of institutional placements is critical in assessing the extent to which children are in institutional settings that provide treatment programs versus congregate care without any therapeutic component. Given the best practice of placing children in the least restrictive (most family-like) setting, this will be valuable information for understanding how wide- spread the use of non-treatment institutionalization is for children in the child welfare system. \u00b7 1355.43(e)(20) Sources of Federal assistance in living arrangement\u2014In light of the fact that many children in the child welfare system are served by, and receive support from, multiple governmental programs, it will be helpful to have more information about which programs are supporting a child\u2019s placement and care. \u00b7 1355.43(d)(7) Child and family circumstances at removal o Response option: Inadequate access to mental health services\u2014This is critical information to collect about children and families involved in the child welfare system since we know that many families struggle to access needed mental health services. This data will provide a better understanding of how wide-spread the practice is of a child entering foster care because of inadequate mental health services in the child\u2019s community. o Response options: Prenatal alcohol exposure and Prenatal drug exposure\u2014These response options are important additions to the data collected about youth entering the child welfare system and provide a critical distinction between a youth\u2019s voluntary drug or alcohol use and a youth\u2019s exposure to dangerous substances before birth. \u00b7 1355.42(e)(5) Private agency living arrangement \u2013 This new data element is an important addition to the data collection about a child\u2019s living arrangement, in light of the increasing use Page 3 \u2013 Voice for Adoption comments\u2014AFCARS of private agencies in child welfare. \u00b7 1355.43(f)3) Concurrent planning \u2013 Adding this data element will provide important information about how common the use of concurrent planning in providing permanency planning services to youth in the child welfare system. I have only two small areas of concern about the proposed regulations, involving the need for more clarity: \u00b7 1355.43(a)(5) Family Record Number \u2013 This data element seems to require greater clarification regarding how \u201cfamily\u201d should be defined. How will this data element deal with the complexity of parents who have children with other adults (resulting in half-siblings and step-siblings)? Does the family record number link to both mother and father, even if they do not live together? This element seems to assume a stable, nuclear family, which we know not to be true for many children in the child welfare system. The regulations should be clear how states should define \u201cfamily\u201d for this data element. \u00b7 1355.46(b) Penalty Amounts \u2013 The use of the word \u201csubsequent\u201d is unclear; subsequent can be interpreted as meaning any time following an event. The wording should be clarified as to whether it means that a state\u2019s penalty will grow to 1/4 of one percent if the state is out of compliance at any point following an initial penalty, or only in the six-month period immediately following the initial penalty period. Since these regulations will be used to implement financial penalties for AFCARS, it is critical that the penalty structure be very clear. As the Children\u2019s Bureau moves forward with improving AFCARS, I hope that the data collected through this revised system will be made available to the public in a timely manner. Thank you for your consideration of VFA\u2019s comments. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Sincerely, Alicia Groh Alicia Groh Executive Director",

The AAP would like to commend ACYF for a thorough, thoughtful proposal that clearly reflects the tremendous energy that went into it. Overhauling and updating the AFCARS system is a daunting task that we expect not to repeat for many years. As a result, it is imperative that this effort proceed deliberately with input from all stakeholders. AFCARS is the single greatest source of data on our nation\u2019s child welfare system. This information is vital to both the federal oversight of state child welfare efforts through the Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSRs) and researchers\u2019 work to understand the individual, community, statewide and national dynamics of child welfare. Because AFCARS is valuable to so many entities, great care must be taken in selecting and defining the data elements that states will be required to report. If the data is unreliable or not useful, the system could hamper rather than facilitate efforts to improve children\u2019s lives. The AAP would like to offer the following comments on each set of data elements. General Information Child Record Number: It is unclear why ACYF proposes that a child be issued a new record number if he or she re-enters care following adoption. It would seem important to know when children re-enter the system after an adoption has been completed. ACYF should develop an alternative method of indicating re-entry to the system after adoption that allows for the child\u2019s previous experiences in the child welfare system to be linked to the new record created. Child Information This section contains an array of critically important new and revised data elements that, if executed properly, could provide a trove of valuable information about children\u2019s experiences in foster care. The AAP applauds ACYF for developing these elements more fully and would like to offer suggestions for further improvements. In particular, the AAP is concerned about the challenges involved in the accurate, appropriate reporting of health and mental health conditions. While the AAP appreciates the alignment of categories of conditions more closely with ICD-9 and DSM-IV codes, it is important to note that the use of a diagnosis code does not necessarily equate with a firm diagnosis of a condition. Given that many children in foster care have complex health conditions that are difficult to unravel, physicians may use diagnosis codes for billing purposes without having affirmed the diagnosis in the child. These fine distinctions may escape social workers or others who are responsible for recording and reporting AFCARS data. This situation is particularly important for the children involved, since a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d \u2013 whether tentative, correct, or incorrect \u2013 may remain in their medical history indefinitely and take on a life of its own. The new requirement that medical history be reported at every AFCARS reporting period could have the inadvertent effect of institutionalizing initial, tentative, or \u201cbest fit\u201d diagnoses for some children. In addition, there is the potential for great confusion about removing this information when it is no longer applicable. A condition may be successfully treated or controlled but still present, either in the context of physical or mental health. In addition, ACYF may wish to consider asking states to distinguish between new and \u201chistoric\u201d diagnoses in each reporting period. The AAP strongly recommends that ACYF develop a concerted, long-term plan to provide training or other resources for state child welfare employees to ensure that health, behavioral, and mental health condition information is reported as accurately and sensitively as possible. This area will require vigilant attention on the part of ACYF to ensure that states have the tools necessary to report reliable data. Caseworkers and supervisors must have not only ongoing information, but access to additional technical assistance or consultative services in the case of difficult or complex conditions. Health, behavioral or mental health conditions: There is significant overlap between conditions that could be considered to fall under \u201cmental retardation\u201d and \u201cdevelopmental disability.\u201d These two categories warrant further clarification. In addition, AAP suggests adding a category for \u201cautism spectrum disorder.\u201d Given the high incidence of mental health needs in the foster care population, it is critically important to understand whether these children are receiving mental health services. Along with diagnosis information, states should be required to report basic data on whether children or families have received selected services. Reporting categories could include hospitalization for psychiatric issues, individual therapy, and family therapy. In addition, AFCARS should develop a method for capturing at least basic data on the use of psychotropic medications among youth in foster care. The AAP suggests requiring states to report whether the child is currently prescribed any psychotropic medication, without requiring caseworkers to report information such as the drug name or dosage. It would also be helpful for AFCARS to require states to report on whether a child has ever been prescribed such medication, even if the child is not currently. Current immunizations: The AAP commends ACYF for including this element, which could be an indicator of whether young children are receiving scheduled well-child visits. It must also be recognized, however, that some children may be receiving vaccines through the local health department in some localities. Special education: ACYF should require states to report whether a child has an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) to address any special educational needs. Prior adoption type: This element will be useful in revealing data on cases such as international adoptees moving into the foster care system. Currently, little data exists in this area. Removal Information The AAP appreciates the much greater detail that will be provided about the circumstances that resulted in a child\u2019s removal from the home. The additional information regarding factors such as prenatal drug or alcohol exposure and inadequate access to vital health or mental health services will greatly improve the sophistication of the data available. Inadequate housing: The AAP recommends establishing a separate option for homelessness, outside the general assessment of housing as \u201csubstandard, overcrowded, unsafe or otherwise inadequate.\u201d Most jurisdictions consider homelessness a de facto reason to remove a child from his or her parents. It would be useful to understand how many children enter foster care because \u2013 independent of any other factor -- one or both parents did not have housing. Disrupted inter-country adoption: This element is an important addition. The AAP recommends also establishing an element for \u201cdisrupted domestic adoption.\u201d \u201cOther\u201d: The AAP recommends the inclusion of an \u201cOther\u201d category that would allow states to capture circumstances that may not be represented on this list, such as the deportation of the parent or guardian. Living Arrangement and Provider Information Number of children living with the minor parent: When the child of a youth in the foster care system is also in the care of the state, that minor child should have a separate identification number and file that is linked to that of the minor parent, much as siblings\u2019 records should be linked. Placement Changes: The section on living arrangements does not appear to capture whether the child has changed placements since the last reporting period and, if so, how many times. The AAP recommends refining this section to require states to report the number of placement changes, even if the type of living arrangement, such as a foster home, has remained the same. This is an important element to assess placement stability. Runaway: Children who run away from foster care are excruciatingly vulnerable to numerous forms of danger and exploitation. The AAP is concerned that states are required only to report runaways under \u201cLiving Arrangement,\u201d rather than noting specifics regarding the duration of runaway status or the establishment of separate categories elsewhere. We urge ACYF to consider options for highlighting data regarding runaways. \u201cLost\u201d Children: Reports have shown that states may lose track of children under a range of circumstances. The AAP encourages ACYF to establish a data element to reflect situations where the child cannot be located but is not a runaway, such as \u201cLocation Unknown.\u201d Exit to Adoption Information Date Information: The AAP recommends requiring states to report the dates of initial pre- adoptive placement and adoption finalization, which would allow for the analysis of the timeliness of adoption processes. Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Subsidy Information Adoption Agreement Information: The AAP recommends clarifying how much information must be reported to AFCARS throughout the duration of the adoption assistance agreement type. If the amount or type of data becomes burdensome to states, this provision could have the unintended effect of serving as a disincentive for states to enter into such agreements. In conclusion, the AAP would like to once again commend the ACYF for proposing improvements to the AFCARS system that could improve significantly our understanding of the experiences of children in the child welfare system. If the AAP may offer further information or expertise, please contact Cindy Pellegrini in our Washington, DC office at 202/347-8600. We appreciate this opportunity to comment and look forward to working together for a healthy future for all children. Sincerely, Ren\u00e9e R. Jenkins, MD, FAAP President RJ: cp",

    "comment": "March 6, 2008 Kathleen McHugh, Director Division of Policy Children\u2019s Bureau/ACF Administration on Children, Youth and Families 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20024 Dear Ms. McHugh: We are pleased that we have the opportunity to submit comments in response to the January 11, 2008 Federal Register notice regarding proposed changes in the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). The researchers who have signed this letter have considerable experience working with California\u2019s SACWIS system and other administrative data. 45 CFR Part 1355 Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System; Proposed Rule The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is to be commended for proposing a data collection system that is intended to facilitate longitudinal analysis of data regarding children in out of home care. While the following comments highlight areas of the regulations that we believe require further work, they should not be interpreted to overshadow the great benefit that a longitudinal data base will bring to our nation\u2019s most vulnerable children. Now that ACF is moving toward the use of a more accurate means of examining child welfare outcomes it becomes even more important to ensure that the data elements being collected are valid and reliable (consistent across states). There are many areas that could benefit from federal guidance in opening the discussion for consistent definitions across the states. These will be discussed in more detail in the specific responses to the regulations. There are several issues that the proposed regulations have yet to address. Among these are the implementation schedule and the file structure. Implementation of these changes will require extensive modification of each state\u2019s Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). These changes can be expected to take several years because of the time required for system design, modification and implication, as well as Federal and other funding agency approval. Our experience in California is that data accuracy and completeness improves over time. It is not unreasonable to expect that it will take several years after modified data collection systems have been placed in service before data quality reaches desired levels. The file structure will need to be different from that of the current Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) file. A longitudinal data system must include all the placements experienced by a child. There are a number of ways that this can be done, but all require multiple rows of data for children who have experienced more than one placement in a time period. The proposed changes suggest either a relational data structure requiring multiple data tables connected by a series of unique identifiers or a nested data structure. The proposed changes include: (1) listing the possible multiple removal episodes for a child; (2) listing the various placement settings for a child (to possibly include non-placement living arrangements such as trial-home visits, hospital visits, runaways); (3) listing the permanency plan options that can change at any time during the removal episode (with a way to identify concurrent planning activities); and (4) listing any changes to placement home structure. The Center for Social Services Research (CSSR) at the University of California, Berkeley has developed one way of formatting data to achieve this end and there are others, such as the format used by the State Data Center for Foster Care and Adoption at Chapin Hall, and the process used by the North Carolina Child Welfare Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We hope that ACF will be open to discussing file structure issues and options with experts in the field who have been doing this for years. We strongly recommend that ACF convene a working group consisting of child welfare data experts to assist in the development of the AFCARS data structure. The following comments address specific provisions of the proposed regulations. These comments are not exhaustive. Rather, they address those issues that we believe to be most problematic. \u00a7 1355.41(a)(i) and (iii): It is not clear whether, by requiring reporting of placements in non-traditional facilities, these regulations are expanding the reporting population to include all children placed in non-foster care facilities (e.g., juvenile halls) by juvenile justice agencies having agreements described in \u00a7 1355.41(a)(i), even when the child\u2019s only placement was in a non-foster care facility. If this is the case, then AFCARS would become a juvenile justice data collection system as well as a child welfare data collection system. In similar fashion, in states where there are agreements with mental health agencies or developmental disabilities agencies, AFCARS could become a reporting system for all children in the care of those agencies. We doubt that such system expansions would facilitate retaining a focus on the core responsibility of child welfare agencies for the care of abused and neglected children. Since not all state agencies have agreements between the child welfare agencies and either mental health, substance abuse, or juvenile justice systems this expansion could end up causing unintended differences across states in system performance. Clarifications need to be in place regarding how these placements, if included, will be affect federal performance outcomes. \u00a7 1355.41(a)(i) and (iii): Currently, there is an exclusion for children removed from their family at birth, but who remain in a hospital and never enter formal out of home care. Will these exclusions continue to exist or should these cases be reported? Clarification will need to be made regarding how some placements not requiring IV-B or IV-E dollars such as hospital visits, trial home visits, and brief detentions should be reported and others such as the example above and informal kinship care should not be reported. \u00a7 1355.42(a): The proposed requirement that data be submitted 15 days after the end of the reporting period sacrifices data quality for timeliness. Our experience is that there is a lag between many events and their entry into the state data system. The data extracts created for CSSR are run 60 days after the end of each quarter. Even with this schedule, each quarterly extract results in modifications to data from earlier quarters. Because of the premium placed on accuracy, we would not want a data system that discouraged such data correction. We encourage ACF to reconsider the timeline for data reporting to recognize the importance of data quality and the desire for states to provide accurate and meaningful data to ACF. This is especially important in light of the penalties that ACF is required to assess on states who are not in compliance with reporting procedures.. \u00a7 1355.43(a)(5): Although the concept of a family record number is attractive, implementation is difficult. \u201cFamily\u201d is not defined anywhere in the regulations and family structure is not a stable mechanism. In its traditional, stereo-typical, form, family is a mother, father and their mutual children. In this circumstance the assignment of a family number is not difficult. However, many children receiving child welfare services come from more complex situations. They may live in multi-generational homes, or with stepsiblings and cousins. A non- resident parent may have children from other relationships. Furthermore, these relationships may not be stable. The child may move from one parent\u2019s home, and the stepsiblings in that home, to another parent\u2019s home, and the stepsiblings in that home. Thus, identifying a family number that will remain constant over time, barring adoption, is not a straightforward request. Any solution to this problem involves compromise. Currently, the definition of sibling groups and family differs from state to state, so this is an area that can benefit from some national discussion and guidance. One solution, but one with obvious problems, is to use the mother\u2019s identifier as the family identifier, i.e., to identify family as a mother, her children and, if one exists, her current partner. \u00a7 1355.43(b) (3): In California, where the largest ethnic group of children is Hispanic, identification of race is difficult. Many Hispanics identify their race as neither White, Native American nor Black, but as Hispanic. In the schema proposed by the regulations, this will result in a high level of \u201crace-unknown\u201d and \u201crace-declined\u201d responses. \u00a7 1355.43(b)(5): This item is unnecessarily complex. We note that the American Community Survey collects language data only on children who are over 5. We believe that a similar threshold would be appropriate. We are perplexed at the languages selected (English, Spanish, Chinese, French, German, Tagalog, Sign Language). While English and Spanish are common languages in California, French, German and Tagalog are rare. In California, English is identified as the primary language of about 86% of children in care and Spanish the primary language of another 11%. Tagalog is identified as a primary or secondary language for 1 of a 1,000 children; French for 1.5 in 10,000; German at a yet lower level. On the other hand, Southeast Asian Languages, primarily Vietnamese, are reported as primary or secondary languages for 0.4% of children in care. Sign language, primarily American Sign Language, is reported as a primary or secondary language for 0.1% of children. While these data are useful for planning at the state level, their relevance at the national level is unclear. If language data would have to be collected, a 4-way classification of English, Spanish, Other, and No Language would be more than adequate. \u00a7 1355.43(b)(6)(i) and (ix): Mental retardation is a type of developmental disability. To avoid double counting of children, either the mental retardation category should be dropped or the developmental disability category should be revised to \u201cdevelopmental disability other than mental retardation.\u201d \u00a7 1355.43(b)(6)(xi): the definition of \u201cOther diagnosed conditions\u201d should clearly indicate that only conditions that have a long-term effect on the child\u2019s functioning are to be reported. \u00a7 1355.43(b)(8)(i) and (ii): Children repeat grades for many reasons, some academic and some social. Having repeated a grade is not necessarily an indication of poor long-term academic performance. We see little, if any, value of collecting this information at a national level. \u00a7 1355.43(b)(8)(iii): Information about special education would be more accurately determined by asking whether the child has a current Individualized Education Plan (IEP). \u00a7 1355.43(b)(10)(ii): Data on children who reenter the foster care system after having been adopted from the foster care system are important. Thus the separation of these adoptions from others is important. However, because adoption statute and terminology vary from state to state the terminology used to describe these non-foster care, non-inter-country adoptions varies. To avoid confusion, the term \u201cother private or independent adoption\u201d should simply be \u201cother adoption.\u201d This would include any non-foster children who were domestically adopted. At a national level, further classification is not meaningful. Especially with infant adoptions, the lines between types of adoption have become increasingly blurred. What is an independent adoption in one state is a private agency adoption in another and a public agency adoption in yet another. The collection of the date of the prior adoption in \u00a7 1355.43(10)(i) will allow separation of infant from other non-foster care adoptions. \u00a7 1355.43(b)(12): While data regarding the status of foster children as minor parents is potentially useful, it is important to recognize that while this data can be collected from girls with some accuracy, information about the number of children that boys in care have fathered is problematic at best. In addition, the item does not specify how to report situations where the minor parent(s) have placed the child for adoption. \u00a7 1355.43(b)(13): Supplemental Security Income benefits, which are based on a child\u2019s income and disability, and Social Security benefits, which are based on the death, disability or retirement of a parent, should be reported separately. \u00a7 1355.43(c): The equating of legal guardians and parents is confusing. In almost all cases, a child who has a legal guardian also has legal parents, although the court has delegated some of the parents\u2019 responsibilities to the guardian. Thus, to collect information about the guardian as though the guardian were a parent is not appropriate. It may be appropriate to have a separate item that asks whether the child was living with a legal guardian at the time of removal. \u00a7 1355.43(c)(3): The mother\u2019s marital status at the time of the child\u2019s birth is of limited interest and utility for the broader population of children reported to AFCARS. This item does not report whether the mother was living with the person she was married to, whether the person the mother was married to was the father or whether the relationship was healthy. Additionally, the usefulness of this metric for children who are entering care from an adoptive homes would be of questionable value. The purpose of this question should be considered carefully, and if it does not have utility within the context of the federal child welfare outcomes system, it should be dropped from the requirements. At the very least it should be focused on the population where this could be most useful, children entering care in the first year of life. \u00a7 1355.43(c)(4) through (7): In many states, including California, parents may voluntarily relinquish their parental rights to an adoption agency. In such circumstances, there is no termination or parental rights petition nor is there a court termination of parental rights. Thus, these items should include that possibility. The proposed regulations do not address the, not uncommon, situation where the potential rights of more than two persons must be dealt with. Most often these are situations where there are two or more men who may be the child\u2019s father. \u00a7 1355.43(d)(4): It is common for a child to be removed at birth. In such situations, should the household composition be that of the household that the mother would have returned to with the child had the child left the hospital with the mother? \u00a7 1355.43(d)(5): The marital status of the biological family at time of removal is not relevant to many of the children in the child welfare system. In the case of an abandoned child or an adopted child (either nationally or internationally adopted) how should this be reported and what is the value? If the intent is to determine if the child was removed from a home where the adults were married then the question should ask whether the primary caretaker at the time of removal was married. This question is in conjunction with the answers to a reformatted \u00a7 1355.43(d)(4) where the primary caretaker at removal is categorically identified and the numbers relate to other adults in the home. \u00a7 1355.43(e): The regulation needs to be clear as to how successive living arrangements are to be reported. The array of placement facility types is much more complicated than necessary for data at the national level. It is only necessary to know if the child is cared for by relatives, by non- relatives in a family setting, or in an institutional or quasi-institutional setting. Thus it would be adequate to use five classes: Relative foster home, Non-relative foster family home, Staffed child care facility, Medical facility, and Juvenile justice detention facility. Because states vary widely as to how the various staffed child care facilities are licensed, the fine distinctions in the proposed regulations would not allow meaningful comparisons between states. \u00a7 1355.43(e)(10): The proposed regulations do not appear to allow for situations where there are two foster parents who are neither an married nor unmarried couple, for example, an adult woman and her mother. \u00a7 1355.43(e)(13), (15), (17) and (19): See earlier comments regarding child\u2019s race and language, which also apply to these items. \u00a7 1355.43(f)(7): The purpose of the annual circumstances is not clear. Many of these circumstances are ones that would have existed at the time of the child\u2019s initial removal, but would have been rendered irrelevant by the removal. Furthermore, whether a \u2018circumstance\u2019 is still relevant at the time of permanency planning is a metric that would be near impossible to get consistent information across the various practice, procedural, and data-entry methods currently in existence across the nation. \u00a7 1355.43(g)(1): While relatively rare, there are situations where only one person in a married couple adopts. The most common instance is when a biological grandparent adopts but the spouse, who is not related to the child, does not adopt. \u00a7 1355.43(g)(4) and (7): See earlier comments regarding child\u2019s race, which also apply to these items. \u00a7 1355.44(b)(2): See earlier comments regarding child\u2019s race, which also apply to this item. \u00a7 1355.45(d): Requiring 100% error-free data for 7 demographic variables is unrealistic and frankly, absurd. What about children who have been abandoned? Do we make up a DOB for these cases \u2013 do we look at them and decide that they look like they belong in a certain racial/ethnic category? It is not uncommon for hospital records to call for 99.8% accuracy. There is always something. As for the 10% error-rate requirement of the rest of the data, this should initially only be applied to items that are already being collected but now being transitioned to a longitudinal format. New items should be considered experimental and optional until ACF and the states have a chance to assess the ability co collect new information and the usefulness of it. Although we would prefer incentives, if penalties are to be assessed, they should only be assessed on the data that has transitioned to a longitudinal format after states have enough time to make this change. New \u201cwell being\u201d items should not be subject to penalties for the time being. Finally, we wish to reiterate our support for the development of a true longitudinal database at the federal level. It will be a great benefit to our nation\u2019s children and their families. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond to the NPRM. We are excited about the potential of AFCARS improvements that will yield better foster care data and more useful performance measures.

    "comment": "STATE OF WYOMING DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY SERVICES Dave Freudenthal, Governor Tony Lewis, Director HATHAWAY BUILDING, 2300 CAPITOL AVENUE, CHEYENNE, WY 82002-0490 (307)777-7561 FAX (307)777-7747 March 4, 2008 Ms. Kathleen McHugh Administration for Children and Families U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Regarding: 45 CFR Part 1355 1250 Maryland Avenue SW, Suite 800 Washington, D.C. 20024 REF: TL-08-027 RE: 45 CFR Part 1355, Adoption Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System Dear Ms. McHugh: The State of Wyoming, Department of Family Services respectfully submits this comment letter regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule Making with Comment Period on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, published in the Federal Register on January 11, 2008 (73 FR 2082) for the Administration for Children and Family Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Wyoming recognizes ACF\u2019s desire for more reliable longitudinal data for the child welfare system. However, the Wyoming Department of Family Services has concerns that this regulation places a significant burden on the state without providing additional funding and support. The State of Wyoming has identified areas of concern regarding provisions of this NPRM, including: \u2022 \u2022 the proposed changes require much more detailed data to be gathered. Extensive changes to Wyoming Children\u2019s Assistance and Protection System (WYCAPS) would be required; extensive time increase for field social workers to track down and maintain additional data elements; TL-08-027 March 4, 2008 Page 2 of 5 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 increasing population, requiring tracking of all elements across all children will greatly increase data input time and training required to do the input; family record number: Tracking by family number as a single entity is not possible for any length of time because of the dynamics of \u2018family,\u2019 divorce, marriage, death, adoption, birth, etc.; languages used: List will be too large and unmanageable; data on all placements regardless of direct responsibility of the Department of Family Services will mean changing security (allowing private agencies to input their own data in the SACWIS system) an increase of interfaces between other agencies and an increase of paperwork between agencies to track data elements; increased expense (drug tests, mental health exams, medical exams\u2026), increased time required to redo all screening and testing; the reduction of the state data reporting window from 45 to 15 days; the large amount of data that states are required to submit; significantly expanded and newly required data elements; the proposed error rates; the proposed penalties; and the huge impact and cost to Wyoming. We appreciate the opportunity to provide you with the following comments: Provisions of the Proposed Rule 1355.40 Scope of the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting Systems. The NPRM definition for out-of-home care would require the state to report on children in living arrangements which are not part of the current reporting requirements. The issues stemming from the proposed rule are described below. 1355.41 Reporting Populations. The proposed AFCARS rule requires reporting to include children \u201cunder the placement and care responsibility of the State agency.\u201d This new definition increases the number of placement settings to be included in the submission, some of which may be outside the control of the foster TL-08-027 March 4, 2008 Page 3 of 5 care agency. The proposal includes children under the placement and care of the child welfare agency who are in juvenile justice and other non IV-E reimbursable placements, such as psychiatric treatment facilities and detention centers. The NPRM proposes changing the definition of when to stop reporting a child in AFCARS. In this proposal, children who go home on trial discharge would no longer be reported to AFCARS. The theory is that the children, while possibly still under supervision of the agency, are no longer fully in the care of the state agency. The change in definition may have a significant effect on the national standards related to length of stay in foster care as well as re-entry rates. The state feels strongly that trial home visits should continue to be reported. 1355.42 Data Reporting Requirements. The NPRM proposes two (2) six-month reporting periods, consistent with the current AFCARS regulations; the State of Wyoming supports continuing this procedure. The NPRM also proposes that the state agency submit data files within 15 days of the end of the report period, a reduction from the current 45-day window. Wyoming is a state administered system and will be burdened with allocating resources to ensure the quality of the data and submitting it within 15 days after end of the reporting period. The elements proposed in the rule would create a very large file, Wyoming would need additional time to process, analyze, and clean data before it is submitted. We recommend the 45-day period be allowed prior to the submission of the data. Reporting additional data elements for children in foster care prior to the finalization of the rule would be an additional burden. Wyoming is currently under an AFCARS Improvement Plan (AIP) that has been approved and is in place. Changes may disrupt that plan causing the State of Wyoming to be out of compliance with our current AIP. 1355.43 Out-of-Home Care Data File Elements. The out-of-home care data file proposed in this NPRM includes a vast array of additional data and research elements. Although longitudinal data collection is important, it is unclear how many of the proposed elements would ensure positive outcomes and would represent quality data. The magnitude of these new elements would overwhelm social workers and would probably lead to inaccurate data collection. Wyoming is concerned about the new elements and the differential definitions applied between AFCARS and the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System. The new elements would move Wyoming Children\u2019s Assistance and Protection System (WYCAPS) from a case management system to a data collection system, to move from collecting narrative information to data fields would be a significant endeavor for Wyoming. The proposed elements would require Wyoming Department of Family Services to rewrite policies, procedures and possibly require changes in the law to require reviews on children in detention facilities. It would be difficult to collect some of the data elements without good definitions of the element, for example following a single family number over time and placements for a child. TL-08-027 March 4, 2008 Page 4 of 5 Family structures are dynamic, so assigning a single number to different configurations of a family would not provide reliable data. The NPRM states that \u201c\u2026having this information will be a greater benefit to ACF and the States than the relatively low burden on caseworkers in collecting the data.\u201d The NPRM also states that the new elements regarding education are, \u201c\u2026relatively simple for a State agency to collect and report.\u201d We contest the accuracy of the statements. It is believed that the new elements represent an onerous burden to staff, systems, and funding resources. The proposed regulation would have a significant financial impact as the state would be required to restructure the information systems, training procedures, and data collection policies for compliance without allowing an implementation timeframe, plan, or funding to support the actions. This section includes research questions that are not necessary for the benefit of longitudinal data; the proposed data collection poses more challenges than benefits. 1355.44 Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Subsidy Data File Elements. Wyoming does not support the imposition of penalties based upon the second data file on adoption assistance and guardianship. It seems unnecessary to submit a file containing information on every child for the period that they are in subsidized guardianship, which might be as long as 20 years for children with special needs. In addition, this reporting could be considered contrary to Public Law 101 regarding the state\u2019s oversight for adoptive family. There is no clarification regarding what candidates should be included in the file. The NPRM is not clear about the requirements for which children should be included from other countries and that are involved in private adoptions. The proposed changes would require significant state- level policy modifications. The changes may also lead to problems with federal policies on adoption assistance by creating different sets of standards. 1355.45 Compliance. The NPRM states that data files will be subject to evaluation in compliance, errors, missing data, invalid data, internally inconsistent data, cross-filing errors and timeliness. ACF proposes that the demographic data collected and submitted be 100 percent accurate. This requirement is impossible to meet. Having this unrealistic requirement may lead social workers to enter inaccurate data in order to ensure that there is no missing data. The new requirements should be implemented in phases in order to allow the state to succeed. The change in policy, procedure, and rule would require tremendous effort and lead to difficulty in retaining social workers as they would be spending a significant portion of the time entering data at the expense of children and families who require services. 1355.46 Penalties. According to the NPRM, strict penalties would go into effect at the time of the final regulation; this does not allow flexibility to completely overhaul their current AFCARS and SACWIS systems. The estimated time to completely rewrite the business rules for the WYCAPS, change policies, train the field staff is unknown, compliance during this period would be impossible. TL-08-027 March 4, 2008 Page 5 of 5 Wyoming does not support the penalties as proposed in the rule. A clear implementation plan needs to be developed before the proposed rule goes into effect. The proposed penalty structure must be reconfigured; the current structure imposes the same penalty on a state that has one error as that of a state with several errors. This is not a system that motivates improvement as the proposed penalty remains the same regardless of the magnitude of errors. Penalties should be commensurate with the degree of errors to allow incremental improvements and an incentive program should be considered. ACF states that the \u201claw requires that we assure that the data submitted to us is reliable and consistent and authorizes us to utilize appropriate requirements and incentives to ensure that the system functions reliably.\u201d According to this statement, there is flexibility for ACF to alter the penalty structure and implement an incentive policy. The data collection process fails to consider factors which would impact the services provided to children and families by the social workers. There are national organizations such as Casey Family Programs that can assist in development of an implementation plan which would be sensitive to the needs of the states. Fiscal Impact. Without clear definitions and timelines, it would be impossible for Wyoming to assess the fiscal impact of the changes. Regardless of the cost estimate of this proposed regulation, it is an enormous burden on the State of Wyoming. Wyoming adds its voice to the other states and professional organizations, such as the Child Welfare League of America, who are also expressing the above concerns.

    "comment": "March 6, 2008 Kathleen McHugh Director Division of Policy Children\u2019s Bureau Administration on Children, Youth and Families Administration for Children and Families 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW., Suite 800 Washington, DC 20024 Dear Ms. McHugh: I am taking this opportunity to comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) issued by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) on January 11, 2008. The proposed changes would significantly expand the volume and variety of data state child welfare agencies submit under the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). While this would entail challenges for states, they must balanced against the fundamentally important shift to a longitudinal data model that ACF has proposed. This change would create a framework for managing and analyzing data that will describe much more accurately and completely the experiences of children entering foster care. In spite of the widely known advantages of this framework, however, it is likely that states will have serious reservations about the proposed regulations and tend to view the proposed changes as: (1) burdensome, both because of the volume of data to be submitted and the introduction of new data elements related to child wellbeing, and (2) threatening in that the inclusion of new wellbeing indicators suggests that the child welfare system will be held solely responsible for the educational progress of children in foster care as well as their health and mental health status. Therefore, care must be taken to implement certain aspects of the proposed changes in a way that is sensitive to the substantial technical and workload challenges they would create. If the proposed regulations are implemented as described, states would have to submit data about each placement in every placement episode for every child who enters out-of-home care.* Presumably, states would be asked to submit data from which a federal contractor * An exception described on p. 2089 pertains to children who had placement episodes prior to the effective date of the regulations. Such an exception could pose an unnecessary analytic limitation by creating a left-censored data set. It is likely that most states could provide some basic data on placement episodes prior to the effective date of the regulations that would address this problem, although it would not resolve it entirely. Ms. Kathleen McHugh March 6, 2008 Page 2 would create analysis files (similar to the processes currently used for AFCARS and National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System [NCANDS] data). A more daunting and resource intensive process for the states would be for each of them to be required to create and update their own database and to provide it to ACF. To achieve consistency and for quality control purposes, it would be more appropriate that ACF follow a process similar to the current approach. Assuming this is the plan, some mechanism must be established by which states can obtain a copy of the database and updates to it to use for self-evaluation purposes such as Program Improvement Plans (PIPs). The proposed regulations do not address the level of technical assistance that the National Resource Center for Child Welfare Data and Technology (NRC-CWDT) or some other contractor would provide along these lines. Beyond the procedural and methodological issues outlined above, the most significant substantive issues concern new data collection and assessment responsibilities pertaining to the health, mental health, and educational status of children in foster care. This expands the volume of data collected under AFCARS and introduces data elements that are not being collected in any consistent fashion by most state child welfare agencies. The underlying significance of this part of the proposal is that it represents ACF\u2019s attempt to systematically obtain data about the wellbeing of children in foster care, the third dimension of the federal child welfare outcome framework of safety, permanency, and wellbeing. This step should not be taken, however, until further consideration has been given to the technical challenges it entails. The assessment instruments and procedures used to collect wellbeing data (or obtained through linkages to other educational and human service data systems) will have to be developed and implemented before valid and reliable data can be collected and compared across states. It is almost certain that ACF ultimately intends to set performance standards within the Child and Family Service Review (CFSR) process in the area of wellbeing outcomes. Standing in the way of this objective, however, are conceptual and analytic challenges inherent in any effort to assess the impact of a child\u2019s foster care experience on their wellbeing. This issue can only be addressed within a longitudinal framework that takes into account the appropriate developmental stages of children and youth, the family and neighborhood contexts in which they have lived, and the variety of public and private services they have received. Unfortunately, the volume and quality of data about both outcomes and moderator variables may not be adequate to support analysis of the foster care experience as a mediator of wellbeing outcomes. From the perspective of state and local child welfare officials, this raises concerns about the extent to which they can be held directly responsible for educational, mental health, and health outcomes given that the wellbeing of children is a collective responsibility of multiple public and private agencies, and local communities. From an analytic perspective, a tenuous theoretical linkage exists in terms of measuring the impact of the child welfare system on the wellbeing of children and youth who enter foster care. This is particularly difficult for the majority of children who have a single relatively brief placement experience that is unlikely to be a key determinant of longer term wellbeing outcomes. Even for the minority of Ms. Kathleen McHugh March 6, 2008 Page 3 children who enter foster care and experience longer than average lengths of stay, it would be very difficult to isolate the impact of the child welfare system relative to influences of family, community, and other service systems The NPRM also introduces new data requirements pertaining to sibling groups in foster care, the characteristics of families of origin and foster families, and the location of each child\u2019s placement setting (\u201cliving arrangement\u201d). Some of these data elements are already captured by many State Automated Child Welfare Information Systems (SACWIS). Unfortunately, proposed regulations discuss the proximity of placements to a child\u2019s home only in terms of out-of-state placement (pp. 2104, 2119, and 2135). However, by requiring that the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for each living arrangement\u2019s location be recorded, it should be possible at least to identify placements outside the child\u2019s home county. Unfortunately, the proposed approach to measurement of location would preclude neighborhood-level analysis of placements within counties; however, the only alternative would be geocoded addresses. Such a requirement would almost certainly be viewed as unacceptably onerous by states whose SACWIS systems do not include well-developed geographic information system (GIS) capabilities. Finally, the proposed regulations call for more detailed information about families of origin, foster families, and adoptive families, including race and ethnicity. The proposed regulations emphasize that self-identification is the preferred approach for determining the racial and ethnic characteristics of children and family members. This is an important issue given the growing number of children who are identified as \u201cmultiracial\u201d or whose race and ethnicity are recorded as \u201cunknown.\u201d If additional details are obtained about families involved with the child welfare system (both as recipients and providers of services), analyses of racial disparities and disproportionality would be enhanced with more accurate and complete data about race and ethnicity. In summary, the NPRM represents a dramatic shift in the type of data available to the federal government for measuring the performance of state child welfare agencies. The proposed approach is consistent with what I and other child welfare researchers have long advocated Unfortunately, the substantial expansion in the volume of data and variety of data elements will be daunting to the states. To encourage their cooperation in this transition, it would be advisable to roll out the changes in three stages that would begin immediately, but allow additional time to complete the second and third stages. The first stage of implementation could be a rapid transition to the compilation of existing data that could be used to build the initial longitudinal database for each state. Our work in Family to Family and other child welfare reform initiatives has demonstrated the feasibility of building longitudinal databases from data extracted from more than 15 participating states. Also, some of these states and others currently subscribe to the State Data Center based at the Chapin Hall Center for Children that we helped establish to facilitate states\u2019 access to longitudinal data. Therefore, the data currently available from state systems would Ms. Kathleen McHugh March 6, 2008 Page 4 make it possible to move ahead quickly with the creation of longitudinal databases for most states with SACWIS systems. The second stage would involve working with states to determine whether and how new data elements are currently being measured across the states and to reach agreement as to how such elements should be measured under the new regulations. The third stage would overlap with the second stage, but would focus on issues related to the measurement of child wellbeing. This stage would require the participation of researchers in child and adolescent development who can help create a sound analytic framework for assessing child wellbeing and the impact of foster care on outcomes in that area. Strong technical assistance will be critical to obtaining states\u2019 cooperation in this effort and to realizing their effective use of new data resources. Part of ACF\u2019s response to comments should be clarification of how the data will be compiled, converted to a longitudinal database, and made available to states for their use in self-evaluation efforts. ACF should make an explicit commitment of technical assistance resources to each state. To begin work on the second and third stages of implementation, ACF or a contractor should convene a series of discussion groups similar to the process used in developing CFSR. The purpose would be to get input on data that are being collected and to assess how current data collection methods would have to be changed or expanded. Issues related to measuring wellbeing are the most complex and challenging, and will require advice from experts in a number of areas. Therefore, the third stage will demand more time and effort before a set of valid and reliable measures can be developed. I commend ACF for moving in this direction and appreciate your consideration of my comments. Sincerely, Charles L. Usher",

New Jersey is strongly committed to using data for analyzing safety, permanency, and well-being outcomes for the children and families we serve. In particular, we are strong advocates for the use of longitudinal data and would support a focused effort in this area. However, NJ strongly disagrees with the proposed amendments present a relatively low burden on caseworkers; are relatively simple for a state agency to collect and report; and that the cost of implementing this rule would not be significant. the ACF statements that In particular, NJ has serious concerns about the impact of the proposed regulations with regard to the day-to-day work of a child welfare agency and its caseworkers. The gathering of the data that is proposed for collection will largely fall on the shoulders of our front-line casework staff. This needs to be balanced with their primary responsibility of serving vulnerable children. It appears the number of elements a worker would need to report on would triple - to roughly 300 elements. Likewise, NJ believes the costs associated with the proposed amendments would be better utilized if they were to provide services for children and families. One suggestion would be to provide federal financial participation for Kinship Legal Guardianship placements rather than to use it to report on the experience of children after adoption. implementing In addition, NJ feels that ACF has underestimated the complexity of child welfare data reporting systems and what is involved in making changes to them \u2013 in terms of time, manpower, and costs. Kathleen McHugh March 7, 2008 Page 2 If adopted, the changes outlined in the NRPM will require New Jersey to undertake a lengthy and costly process to redesign elements of our new SACWIS system. The NPRM does not propose an implementation process, funding strategies or time frame for the changes. It does not factor in the need for additional staff resources during system design and development; staff training; programming changes; contingency plans; data retention issues; and the process of data transmission. According to the NPRM, penalties would go into effect when the final regulations are adopted. Given the significant changes NJ would have to make to its newly functional SACWIS system, NJ suggests an implementation time frame (minimally 4 years) be provided prior to any imposed penalties. In the following paragraphs, NJ provides more detailed comments on the proposed amendments. 1355.41 Reporting Population The expansion of the reporting population to include children in living arrangements such as detention facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and jails will result in the child welfare agency being dependent upon on other state and private agency systems to collect and report the required information in a timely manner. There is no precedence for this, and it places an unfair burden on the child welfare agency. In addition, ACF proposes to implement this while decreasing the error threshold and adding penalties. This is unreasonable. NJ feels that reporting on post-adoption and subsidized kinship legal guardianship populations is too expansive and raises legal questions relating to statute and privacy laws. NJ fully supports eliminating the practice of \u201ctrial home visits\u201d in data reporting. 1355.42 Data Reporting Requirements The addition of a \u201cfamily record\u201d number presents many challenges in terms of definition, file structure, and overall management. NJ believes the addition of a family record its the complexity of number implementation until further analysis occurs by ACF and the states. reporting significantly and opposes increases NJ strongly opposes the reduction in time for the submission of data files from 45 days to within 15 days. The shortened time frame puts an unnecessary emphasis on speedy submission at the expense of the integrity and validity of the data. Our opposition is based on the following factors: a vast increase in the data required; a high threshold for error-free data; and the implementation of penalties Instead, NJ requests ACF allow for a 60 day time period for submission. Kathleen McHugh March 7, 2008 Page 3 1355.43 Out of Home Care Data File Elements It is NJ\u2019s position that reporting on the following elements are excessive, have limited or no value in measuring outcomes, and in some cases goes beyond the intent of the source legislation: Indicating all the languages the child uses Indicating the language with which the child has the \u201cgreatest facility\u201d \u00a7 Whether the child is verbal; preverbal or non-verbal \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 Grade level performance \u00a7 Finalization date of the child\u2019s prior adoption \u00a7 Type of adoption the child previously experienced \u00a7 The FIPS code for where the child was previously adopted \u00a7 The number of children the young person being reported on has \u00a7 Expansion of reporting on the types of financial assistance the child receives \u00a7 Reporting on all the adults in the household at the time of removal \u00a7 Reporting all removal dates \u2013 past and present \u00a7 Reporting on whether the parents are married and whether they are living together at the time of removal The proposed 15 day time frame requirement for the \u201cremoval transaction date\u201d to be entered is impractical. There are many child and family focused casework activities which take place around removal and placement and these activities must take precedence over data entry timing. The proposed reporting of a juvenile as a \u201cstatus offender,\u201d even if the status is alleged, is not appropriate and is misleading. Instead of introducing new elements, ACF should consider making AFCARS and NCANDS more compatible with each other. In the event, ACF proceeds with the amendments, NJ suggests the proposed changes for the out-of-home care data file be tested in pilot states; a financial incentive given for pilot participation; and subsequently be phased in throughout the country with a grace period prior to penalties being imposed. 1355. 44 Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Subsidy Data File Elements Many NJ children who have special needs and disabilities receive an adoption or guardianship subsidy for years until they reach adulthood. It seems inappropriate to report information on each child who is part of an adoptive family. We believe this is unnecessarily intrusive and an excessive burden. As noted earlier, we believe it is subject to legal challenge. Kathleen McHugh March 7, 2008 Page 4 1355. 45 Compliance ACF proposes that the State submit 100 % error free data for the basic demographic elements and within 15 days. We believe both of these standards are unrealistic. A 15 day time period increases the likelihood of inaccurate and invalid data. NJ recommends an 95% accuracy rate and a 60 day period for submission. A 60 day window is supported by the fact that the number of data elements triples to 300 and the amendments are accompanied by the implementation of penalties. 1355.46 Penalties Rather than focusing on penalties, ACF should focus its attention on the refinement of SACWIS systems and the integration of AFCARS and NCANDS data systems. If ACF pursues the implementation of penalties, a longer and more practical timetable for implementation should be followed given the large increase in data to be collected and all the previously outlined issues associated with this. NJ supports the exclusion of adoption assistance and guardianship files from penalties. NJ would also like to point out that it, along with many other states, is facing significant fiscal constraints. It is unlikely that additional funding would be available to institute the changes needed in our SACWIS system to implement these amendments. In summary, although we support the intent of focused longitudinal data reporting, NJ believes that the proposed amendments threaten the quality of service provision by caseworkers while simultaneously compromising data quality through unreasonable timeframes, penalty provisions, and the extreme details of some data elements. The proposed amendments present an unreasonable cost burden and underestimate the complexity of implementing the changes by both staff and SACWIS systems.

    "comment": "March 5, 2008 Kathleen McHugh, Director, Division of Policy Children\u2019s Bureau Administration on Children, Youth, and Families Administration for Children and Families 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW Suite 800 Washington, DC 20024 RE: 45 CFR Part 1355 Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) Proposed Rules - State of Delaware Response Dear Ms. McHugh; The State of Delaware appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the substantial changes that have been proposed within the Federal Register dated January 11, 2008, associated with 45 CFR Part 1355, Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). We have major concerns with the proposal and with our capacity to meet the expansive requirements as written. These requirements place heavy increased data collection expectations on the frontline casework staff that is responsible for the safety, permanency, and well being of the State\u2019s children and families. We place strong emphasis with our staff regarding face to face contacts with the children and families we serve. We continue to seek ways to remove or reduce the administrative burden on our frontline personnel so that they can spend more time with children and families in their homes and in their communities. These newly proposed rules place additional administrative burden on our state\u2019s frontline staff related to data collection and data entry and further reduce the time that they can spend directly with children and families. Increasing data elements from 100 to 300 is extreme. We would encourage the Children\u2019s Bureau to consider alternate proposals to obtain only mission critical items over a multi-year strategy. While we can agree that the availability of comprehensive data could be useful in helping to shape the direction of child welfare services, implementing these new requirements places a significant fiscal and resource impact on the states. It fails to recognize the state\u2019s existing budgetary constraints and approval processes for IT related changes. 1 This proposal increases data collection across state agencies in an effort to meet the requirements as written, including the development and implementation of interagency interfaces. The child welfare agency bears the cost and the resource obligations for these new interfaces. Regardless of the availability of a federal share, the State still faces a substantial financial burden at a time when resources are already constrained. Delaware has made significant changes associated with its AFCARS data collection efforts under a voluntary review and improvement plan. The newly proposed rules do not address a state\u2019s obligation under an existing AFCARS Improvement Plan, especially in those areas where the plan requirements and the NPRM are inconsistent. Delaware has recently completed changes to its SACWIS, which would now have to be modified if these regulations are adopted. Some proposals for SACWIS modification are under discussion with ACF as we develop Delaware\u2019s CFSR program improvement plan; the NPRM would make those changes non-conforming before they are even implemented. The regulations should include clear guidance to states as to how to proceed through the transition so that resources are not wasted. We support the continuation of the semi-annual reporting. We do not, however, support the new timeframe of 15 calendar days after the reporting period. It seems unreasonable to shorten the timeframe for submission while increasing the number of data elements from 100 to 300. This is particularly true for children entering care late in the reporting period and with the collection of data from agencies outside of our Department, specifically contracted and out of state providers. We encourage another look at this in the context of our state\u2019s overall remarks. The comments below address the State of Delaware\u2019s remarks in six major theme areas. 1. Expanding Reporting Population Delaware is one of a few state agencies in the country that provides traditional child welfare services, juvenile justice services, and child mental health services in a single state agency. Although the department is the single state agency for provision of services under Titles IV-B/IV-E, the majority of youth receiving traditional child welfare services are served by the Division of Family Services. Custody has been the determining factor relative to whether a child is deemed to be in out of home placement. With the expansion of the population, children in juvenile justice and mental health residential placements may be in the \u201ccare\u201d of the department, but the \u201cresponsibility\u201d is more limited in scope, with parents retaining legal custody and a broader role. In some instances our Child Mental Health Services division may not have \u201ccare\u201d responsibilities and may only facilitate helping parents and children receive voluntary mental health services. Delaware requires clarification as to whether \u201clegal custody\u201d remains the threshold for inclusion. Delaware recently made SACWIS modifications that address elements of this expanded target population, as well as costly modifications to its workflow, and added new data collection requirements for staff. Delaware\u2019s SACWIS, known as FACTS, currently 2 collects client out of home care instances through placement summary information which is defined through specific division and placement activity across each of the three service divisions. The divisions include Family Services (DFS), Youth Rehabilitative Services (DYRS) and Child Mental Heath Services (DCMHS). The collection of data by DCMHS and DYRS would require significant expansion for those children not served jointly with DFS. This would create a drain on already strained financial resources and manpower. As a result of the above, Delaware recommends that a more specific definition of \u201cplacement and care\u201d be provided. The proposed AFCARS reporting requirement would constitute a duplicative and redundant DHSS reporting requirement for the Child Mental Health Services division in our state which reports to SAMHSA. There may be other instances where the state would be required to report duplicative information to meet the demands of multiple federal agencies. There needs to be a sensitivity to the burden this places on states. Lastly, it is not clear if the other federal health care and substance abuse regulations, HIPAA and 24 CFR Part 2, would permit the information release without explicit individual consent. It is also not clear as to whether the file encryption and the use of an encrypted identifier provides adequate protection to ensure compliance with HIPAA. 2. Capturing Greater Data Detail This section of the federal proposal is expansive to the extent that the demands for data seem to override the concern for service delivery. One of the potential impacts of this focus is that case workers will lose sight of the client as they are driven toward compliance. Delaware suggests that both the clients and the data system would be better served if the focus was on gathering and reporting the most critical data, rather than on reporting such extensive data about every aspect of the child and family circumstance. Since penalties will be imposed for incomplete or inaccurate data, there is an increased likelihood that workers will be pressured to meet the data need first. In our quest to develop comprehensive longitudinal data, an unintended consequence could be the diminution of service delivery. With the same or fewer numbers of case workers and increased expectations, the extensive data burden could cause harm. To comply, Delaware would have to re-program many parts of its SACWIS database and complete an overhaul of its AFCARS file. Much information that is now captured in free- form notes would be converted to pre-defined selections. While this may enhance reporting and promote consistency in data, it may not improve the descriptiveness of the family and child circumstance. In addition, it is likely to impact workflow processes. Simply stated, practice would be driven by data collection needs. Delaware is opposed to the extensiveness of changes to data that must be reported. Our preliminary analysis indicates that there are over 40 instances in the out of home placement or adoption requirements where an element is new or must be modified in 3 some way to comply with the proposed regulations; the change may involve something as simple as adding or modifying values or it may involve adding extensive new functionality and practice, with out-of-state adoptions being handled manually. Given that Delaware\u2019s SACWIS is built largely on work flows rather than flat tables, the modifications are likely to be major, especially for DYRS and DCMHS. Accompanying each of these changes is the need to ensure that the case worker captures and records the information in the required manner. Some of the elements must be updated each and every time a child enters, moves through, or exits out of home care, such as foster family home type and, in some instances, updated as the information becomes available. Delaware believes that the NPRM understates the potential impact on states. Delaware is interested in participating in a national dialogue, which we believe is essential to reaching the level of understanding and consistency required to successfully implement this. This will allow states to gain a uniform understanding of the rationale and analytical benefits of all aspects of this data collection. 3. Improving Data Quality Clearly, providing high quality data about children and families served by the child welfare system is a result desired by all stakeholders. However, unless the plan to transition states to the new regulations allows time for re-design and system modifications (work flow and data systems), the implementation of this wholesale change will result in data quality problems, at least at the outset. States will need to secure funding and associated approvals both at the state and federal levels to re-program the SACWIS and change the AFCARS file structure. They will need to train staff and re- design processes and forms so that correct data is captured. Such changes will require a phased implementation. The result of a transition not properly phased would likely be high penalty rates for states, again shifting the focus from client service to data gathering as states feel the pressure to meet these extensive reporting requirements. Even with time, Delaware believes that achieving compliance will be a challenge. Delaware has historically used the 45-day submission window as a period for quality checks and data clean-up prior to submitting the AFCARS file. While this is not ideal, it represents the reality associated with demands placed on case workers as they try to balance direct service, data gathering, and data entry demands. The timeliness requirement for data entry on selected elements, coupled with demands for substantially more information and the shortened time frame for submission seems to run counter to a true goal of maximizing the likelihood of improving data quality. This is of particular concern with contracted and out of state providers who serve our children and families. As stated earlier, Delaware is opposed to the shortening of the submission time frame. 4. Restructuring Data Delaware has addressed one of its major concerns about restructuring data in its response on page 3, Item 2, in which there are an extensive number of items being modified. At a 4 minimum, a modification involves changing or adding table values to ensure that proper definitions and selections are provided to case workers. For states, this is not always a simple change in terminology, but may mean mapping old information to new tables where possible. There will be an accompanying need to re-train staff to report information in a different way (this can also negatively impact data quality as staff makes the transition to new definitions and selections). The regulations clearly impose requirements for new structures in the database and for new reporting file structures. The regulations leave the discretion for file format to ACF \u2013 a determination to be made outside of the regulations. While this makes sense in the context of ever-changing technology, it leaves states susceptible to file changes totally at the discretion of the federal agency and prevents states from accurately projecting cost and workload associated with implementing the regulation. At a minimum, the regulation should include parameters to govern how and when file configuration requirements are to be set. Each time an AFCARS file must be re-formatted, the state incurs costs. 5. Eliminating Unnecessary Features Delaware supports the proposed elimination of the two summary tables. 6. Fiscal Impact Based on a high level review of the proposed AFCARS changes, we estimate that the initial changes to our state\u2019s SACWIS are $500,000 plus. This is a high level estimate as it is still unclear about the scope of data collection within the juvenile justice and mental health service divisions. The type of technology used, XML or flat files, will also affect the information technology financial investment. This could further increase the cost. Delaware has not been able to determine the additional costs associated with staff time, training, and additional interface needs. Given the unanswered questions reflected in these comments, Delaware cannot make a more refined estimate at this time. In summary, Delaware has substantial concerns about the breadth of changes and the extensiveness of the information ACF is proposing as part of the AFCARS reporting requirements. Delaware has a small foster care population relative to many other states, but its SACWIS is designed as a more complex relational database. The cost to implement the proposed AFCARS requirements, both in real dollars and in workforce effort, will be substantial. Delaware strongly encourages ACF to reconsider the scope of the reporting requirements; to consider each requirement in the context of value added as measured against a realistic assessment of the burden of information collection for states; to limit the information required to the most mission-critical, rather than forming a comprehensive research database; and to carefully consider an implementation strategy that affords states an opportunity to successfully participate in reporting. 5 Your consideration of the State of Delaware\u2019s comments is appreciated.

    "comment": "NATIONAL COURT-APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE PROGRAM U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report 07-04 December 2006 NATIONAL COURT-APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE ASSOCIATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As required by Congress, the U.S. Department of Justice Office (DOJ) of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of the National Court-Appointed Special Advocate Association (NCASAA).1 The objectives of this audit, as mandated by Congress, were to determine: (1) the types of activities NCASAA has funded since 1993, and (2) the outcomes in cases where court-appointed special advocate (CASA) volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved, including: \u2022 the length of time a child spends in foster care;2 \u2022 the extent to which there is an increased provision of services; \u2022 the percentage of cases permanently closed;3 and \u2022 achievement of the permanent plan for reunification or adoption.4 1 Pub. L. No. 109-162 (2006) 2 Generally, prior studies of the CASA program and the data tracked by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on children in the state and local child protective services (CPS) system reported on children in out-of-home care rather than children in foster care. The information reported on children in out-of-home care includes all children in foster care, as well as children placed with a relative or legal guardian, who was not a qualified foster parent. Since the prior studies and available HHS data did not include information on only those children in foster care, in this report we considered all children in out-of-home care to be in \u201cfoster care\u201d for the purposes of addressing this objective. 3 All state and local CPS cases are eventually permanently closed because even in those cases for which permanent placement of the child was not achieved, the case is closed when the child reaches the age of majority, is incarcerated, or dies. As a result, for the purposes of this audit we defined permanent closure as those cases that had been closed by CPS, whether due to permanent placement or any other reason, and the child had not reentered the Child Welfare System (CWS) at anytime prior to the date the case data was collected for this audit. 4 For each child in the CWS, a permanent plan for the placement of the child is developed. The permanent plan outlines what will happen to the child upon resolution of the cases. Generally, the permanent plan is either reunification with the parents or adoption. Background In 1976, Superior Court Judge David Soukup of Seattle, Washington, concluded that he was not obtaining sufficient relevant facts during case hearings necessary to ensure that the long-term welfare of the child was being represented. To address this concern, he developed the concept of recruiting and training community volunteers to represent the best interest of the child in court proceedings. In 1977, the first CASA pilot program was implemented in Seattle. The purpose of the CASA program is to ensure that abused and neglected children receive high-quality, sensitive, effective, and timely representation in court hearings to determine their guardianship. In 1978, the National Center for State Courts selected the Seattle CASA program as the best national example of citizens participating in juvenile justice, resulting in the replication of the program in courts across the country. By 1982, it was clear that a national association was needed to coordinate the 54 existing state and local CASA programs and provide training and technical assistance. As a result, in 1984 NCASAA was incorporated and its headquarters office was opened in Seattle. At the time NCASAA was incorporated, there were 107 state and local CASA programs in 26 states.5 As of 2005, there were 948 state, local, and tribal CASA programs in 49 states that served an estimated 226,204 children.6 Statistics on Child Abuse in the United States According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in fiscal year (FY) 2004, an estimated 3 million children were alleged to have been neglected or abused and were the subject of investigation or assessment by state or local child protective services (CPS) agencies.7 Additionally, in FY 2004: \u2022 Approximately 872,000 children were identified as victims of maltreatment. 5 These programs include both CASA volunteers and guardian ad litem (GAL) volunteers, who are generally lawyers appointed by the court to represent children in abuse or neglect cases. A CASA volunteer may also be a GAL or work in conjunction with a GAL. 6 North Dakota is the only state with a CASA program that is not a member of NCASAA because it uses paid advocates rather than volunteers. 7 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children, Youth and Families, Children\u2019s Bureau, Child Maltreatment 2004, (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2006). - ii - \u2022 An estimated 1,490 children died as a result of child abuse or neglect. \u2022 More than 80 percent of the children who died were 4 years old or younger. An HHS report, The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) Report No. 13, Preliminary FY 2005 Estimates, September 2006 (2005 AFCARS report), estimated that as of September 30, 2005:8 \u2022 An estimated 513,000 children were in foster care. \u2022 The average age of children in foster care was 10 years old and the average length of stay in foster care was 28.6 months. \u2022 118,000 children were awaiting adoption. Further, according to the 2005 AFCARS report, in FY 2005 approximately 311,000 children entered foster care, while 287,000 exited foster care. Office of Justice Programs Since 1984, DOJ Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has worked to improve the juvenile justice systems and assist crime victims. The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990, as amended, authorized the OJP Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to administer a newly created CASA grant program. The OJP Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) also provides funding through the Tribal Court CASA Program, which assists in developing and enhancing programs that provide volunteer advocacy for abused or neglected Native American children. Additionally, CASA programs are also eligible to receive Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funding at the state level, which provides support services to crime victims. OJP partners with NCASAA to administer the CASA grant program and provide funding, training, and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal CASA programs. Since 1993, OJP has awarded NCASAA 15 grants totaling 8 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children, Youth and Families, Children\u2019s Bureau, The AFCARS Report No.13, Preliminary FY 2005 Estimates, September 2006. - iii - $100.4 million, including 12 OJJDP grants totaling $98.52 million and 3 OVC grants totaling $1.88 million. Summary of Findings and Recommendations Activities Funded by NCASAA To determine the types of activities funded by NCASAA since 1993, as mandated by Congress, we requested that NCASAA provide accounting data from January 1, 1993, through June 30, 2006, for all expenditures from both federal and non-federal funding sources. We found that NCASAA did not retain any accounting records or supporting documentation for expenditures occurring prior to 1995. Additionally, although NCASAA retained some of the accounting records and supporting documentation for 1995 through 1997, the information was incomplete. According to federal regulations (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 70), grantees are only required to retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to Department of Justice grants for a period of 3 years from the date of submission of the final financial report. Because NCASAA was not required to and did not retain the accounting records and supporting documentation for its expenditures occurring prior to 1998, we cannot provide information regarding activities funded by NCASAA prior to that time in this report. However, we were able to obtain information related to the activities funded by NCASAA from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006. As shown in Table 1, from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006, NCASAA expended $88.86 million in funds received through OJP grant programs and $14.24 million in funds received from all other sources including foundations. - iv - TABLE 1. NCASAA EXPENDITURES BY ACTIVITY, JANUARY 1, 1998, THROUGH JUNE 30, 2006 (MILLIONS)9 TOTAL FEDERAL FUNDING PERCENT OF TOTAL FEDERAL FUNDING TOTAL FUNDING NON-FEDERAL SOURCES PERCENT OF TOTAL FUNDING NON-FEDERAL SOURCES $ 57.16 64.33% $ 3.29 23.10% 13.63 11.98 $82.77 $ 6.09 0.0 $ 6.09 15.34% 13.48% 93.15% 4.71 4.36 $12.36 6.85% 0.00% 6.85% $ 0.91 0.97 $ 1.88 33.08% 30.62% 86.80% 6.39% 6.81% 13.20% $88.86 100% $14.24 100% ACTIVITIES FUNDED DIRECT ACTIVITIES Awards to Subgrantees Training & Technical Assistance Membership & Public Outreach Subtotal SUPPORT ACTIVITIES General & Administrative Fundraising Subtotal TOTAL ACTIVITIES FUNDED 10 Source: NCASAA general ledgers We also found that: \u2022 NCASAA expended $82.77 million (93.15 percent) of its OJP grant funding on activities that directly supported CASA programs. The direct activities funded by NCASAA include: (1) awards to subgrantees to support state and local CASA programs, (2) training and technical assistance for state and local CASA programs, and (3) membership and public outreach. \u2022 NCASAA expended $6.09 million (6.85 percent) of its OJP grant funding on general and administrative support activities, which is significantly less than the 16.3 percent average administrative costs for human services non-profit organizations.11 9 The amounts reported in this table reflect the activities funded by NCASAA as determined by our audit. 10 Differences in total amounts are due to rounding, e.g., the sum of individual numbers prior to rounding may differ from the sum of the individual numbers rounded. 11 Thomas H. Pollak and Mark Hager, The Urban Institute, and Patrick Rooney, Indiana University, \u201cUnderstanding Management and General Expenses of Non-profits,\u201d an Overhead Cost Study Working Paper presented at the 2001 Annual Meeting of the Association for Research on Non-profit Organizations and Voluntary Actions, New Orleans, LA, 2001. - v - During our review of NCASAA\u2019s accounting records, we found that from 1999 through 2006 NCASAA recorded that it allocated $1.23 million of its OJP grant funds to fundraising activities. However, we determined that this was the result of an accounting error and that NCASAA did not use OJP grant funds for fundraising activities. We also found that in 1998 and 1999 NCASAA failed to input a program accounting code identifying the program activity for expenses totaling about $1.5 million. We informed NCASAA of these errors during our review, and they have since been corrected. Court-Appointed Special Advocate Program Outcomes We found that with the exception of the length of time a child spends in foster care, HHS does not require state and local CPS programs to report data that specifically addresses the outcome measures mandated by Congress for this audit. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide data that specifically addresses the outcome measures required for this audit. As a result, although we obtained data for the state and local CASA programs that we used to address the audit objectives, we were not always able to obtain comparison data for cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. We also found that OJP had established outcome measures for its CASA grant programs. However, the outcome measures established by OJP do not address the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. Additionally, none of the outcome measures established by OJP address the outcome measures mandated for this audit. In our judgment, OJP should develop outcome performance measures for the CASA grant programs to determine the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. As appropriate, these outcome measures should correspond with the data required by HHS for state and local CPS agencies, so that OJP has a basis for comparing the effectiveness of its CASA grant programs. Because of the lack of data on the objectives mandated for this audit, to determine the outcomes in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved, we relied on the following: \u2022 prior studies of the NCASAA program; \u2022 data on (1) the length of time a child spends in foster care, (2) the extent to which there is an increased provision of services, (3) the percentage of cases permanently closed, and (4) achievement of the - vi - permanent plan for reunification or adoption from the state and local CASA program case-tracking databases (CASA Data Request), which we compared to national data on the same measures maintained by HHS for all CPS cases, including both CASA and non-CASA cases; \u2022 data from an OIG survey distributed to all state, local, and tribal CASA program offices; and \u2022 the most recent AFCARS data available at the time our analysis was conducted on all children in the state and local CPS for comparison purposes.12 We identified two studies of the CASA program that in our judgment provided the most comprehensive and current information related to this objective. \u2022 Youngclarke, Davin M. and Kathleen Ramos and Lorraine Granger-Merkle. \\\"A Systematic Review of the Impact of Court-Appointed Special Advocates,\\\" Journal of the Center for Families, Children and the Courts, Vol. 5, 2004, pp. 109-126 (Youngclarke Review). The Youngclarke Review summarized the findings of 20 prior studies that assessed the impact of CASA programs. In conducting the review, almost 70 prior studies of CASA programs were analyzed, but only 20 met the criteria for inclusion in the results of the Youngclarke Review. The review compares the combined average outcome measures reported in the prior studies for cases involving a CASA volunteer to those for which a CASA volunteer was not appointed. \u2022 Caliber Associates, Evaluation of CASA Representation, 2004, (Caliber Study).13 The Caliber Study combines data from NCASAA\u2019s management information systems and data collected through the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a federally sponsored national survey of children and their families. The study compares outcome measures for cases involving a CASA volunteer to those for which a CASA volunteer was not appointed. 12 It should be noted that HHS does not collect separate data on CASA cases. Rather, the AFCARS data includes all CASA and non-CASA cases related to children in the state and local CPS. 13 It should be noted that the Caliber Study was funded in part by NCASAA. Funding was also provided by the Packard Foundation. - vii - For the CASA Data Request, NCASAA distributed our request for data on the four outcome measures from the case management systems to 731 state, local, and tribal CASA programs. We received data related to time in foster care, permanent case closure, and the case outcomes including adoption and reunification from 192 respondents representing 339 programs. However, we generally did not receive data on the number of services ordered by the courts and received by children and their parents because it was not generally tracked in the case management systems. Additionally, we distributed a nationwide survey to state, local, and tribal CASA programs offices requesting information on the four outcome measures, as well as additional information on the: (1) basis for the responses related to the four outcome measures in our survey, (2) effectiveness of NCASAA, and (3) data reported in the Caliber Study, which was the most recent study available related to the outcome measures. Out of the 945 CASA programs to which the OIG survey was sent, we received 491 responses. The consolidated results of the OIG survey are detailed in Appendix II. The results of our audit related to the outcomes in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved for (1) the length of time a child spends in foster care, (2) the extent to which there is an increased provision of services, (3) the percentage of cases permanently closed, and (4) achievement of the permanent plan for reunification or adoption, are discussed in the following sections. Length of Time in Foster Care We found that the length of time a child spends in foster care is longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. As shown in Table 2, the Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study found that the average length of time a child spends in foster care is between 3.9 months and 1.5 months longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer. - viii - TABLE 2. LENGTH OF TIME IN FOSTER CARE PRIOR STUDIES STUDY Youngclarke Review Caliber Study TIME IN FOSTER CARE (MONTHS) CASA 23.9 10.2 NON-CASA 20.0 8.7 DIFFERENCE FOR CASA + 3.9 + 1.5 Source: Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study It should be noted that both the Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study concluded that there was no significant difference in the length of time a child spends in foster care for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. We also found that the length of time a child spends in foster care is longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to the national average for all CPS cases, including CASA cases.14 As shown in Table 3, based on the CASA Data Request and the OIG survey the average length of time a child spends in foster care is between 2 months and 1.2 months longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer than the national average for all CPS cases. TABLE 3. LENGTH OF TIME IN FOSTER CARE OIG ANALYSIS TIME IN FOSTER CARE (MONTHS) SURVEY CASA Data Request OIG Survey16 CASA 15.8 17.2 AFCARS15 13.8 16.0 DIFFERENCE FOR CASA + 2.0 + 1.2 Source: CASA Data Request, OIG survey, 2004 and 2005 AFCARS Report 14 For the CASA program case system data request and the OIG survey, we used the weighted average of the length of time a child spends in foster care where a CASA volunteer is involved. 15 For the CASA Data Request, we compared the weighted average of the length of time a child spends in foster care where a CASA volunteer is involved to the 2004 AFCARS data which was the most recent data available at the time our analysis was conducted. It should be noted that AFCARS data includes all CASA and non-CASA cases related to children in the state and local CPS. For the OIG survey, we compared the weighted average of the length of time a child spends in foster care where a CASA volunteer is involved to the 2005 AFCARS data. 16 The weighted average number of months in foster care that was calculated for the OIG survey is based on the number of respondents rather than children. - ix - Although we found that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were on average in foster care longer, this is not necessarily an indication that the CASA program is not effective. We base our conclusion on the following: \u2022 According to the Caliber Study, cases assigned to a CASA volunteer frequently involve the most serious cases of maltreatment and these children were more at risk. As a result, for the majority of cases involving a CASA volunteer, the children were placed in foster care much more frequently than in cases not referred to a CASA program office. \u2022 Based on the results of the OIG survey, we found that the majority of respondents estimated that on average 81 to 100 percent of the children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were placed in foster care prior to the time that the case was referred to the CASA program office. \u2022 As shown previously in Table 3, from the CASA Data Request and the OIG survey, we found that in cases involving a CASA volunteer the total time the child was in foster was 2 and 1.2 months longer than in cases not involving a CASA volunteer, respectively. However, from the CASA Data Request and the responses to the OIG survey, we found that for cases involving a CASA volunteer, the child was in foster care an estimated average of 5.5 and 4.5 months, respectively, prior to the time that the case was referred to a CASA program office. Therefore, the time children spent in foster care prior to the assignment of a CASA volunteer directly affects the fact that children with a CASA volunteer were in foster care longer. Number of Services Provided Examples of services ordered by the court for children include mental health, medical treatment, and training in independent living if children are close to the age of majority. Services ordered by the court for parents include mental health, drug, and alcohol treatment, as well as training on basic health and domestic violence. The Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study both included the number of services ordered for children and the parents of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases not involving a CASA volunteer. This information was obtained from actual CASA, CPS and court case files and through interviews of CASA and CPS officials. Based on the Youngclarke - x - Review and the Caliber Study, on average between 2.1 and 3.1 additional services were ordered by the court for children and the parents of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer, as shown in Table 4. TABLE 4. NUMBER OF SERVICES ORDERED FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS STUDY OR SURVEY Youngclarke Review Caliber Study NUMBER OF SERVICES ORDERED CASA 9.0 19.1 NON-CASA 6.9 16.0 DIFFERENCE FOR CASA + 2.1 + 3.1 Source: Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study We were unable to verify the results of the Youngclarke Review and the Caliber Study. The number of services ordered for children and the parents of children in the CWS is not an outcome that is generally tracked by state, local, and tribal CASA programs in their case management systems. Therefore, we were unable to obtain sufficient data related to this outcome measure from the CASA Data Request. Based on the OIG survey, we found that on average 8.1 services were ordered for the children and parents of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer. However, HHS does not require state and local CPS programs to report data on the number of services ordered. As a result, we were unable to compare the information we obtained from the OIG survey to the national average. Percentage of Cases Permanently Closed All state and local CPS cases are eventually permanently closed, even those cases for which permanent placement of the child was not achieved, when the child reaches the age of majority, is incarcerated, or dies. As a result, for the purposes of this audit, we defined permanent closure as those cases that had been closed for any reason and the child had not reentered the CWS at anytime prior to the date the case data was collected for this audit. The Youngclarke Review found that cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be \u201cpermanently closed\u201d as compared to cases not involving a CASA volunteer. Specifically, the review found that only 9 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer reentered the CWS as compared to 16 percent of children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. - xi - The Caliber Study did not provide data on the percentage of children who reentered the CWS; rather, the study reported on the number of cases for which subsequent allegations of abuse were reported. The Caliber Study found that: \u2022 Subsequent allegations of abuse were reported for 36 percent of the closed cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to 25 percent of the closed cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. \u2022 Conversely, subsequent allegations of abuse were reported for only 34 percent of the open cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to 52 percent of the open cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. It should be noted that the Caliber Study did not determine whether the subsequent allegations of abuse were substantiated. Additionally, the Caliber Study concluded that there was no significant difference in the subsequent allegations of abuse related to children with or without a CASA volunteer. HHS does not require state and local CPS agencies to report data on permanent case closure or the number of children who reenter the CWS. Further, NCASAA does not require that its CASA program members provide reentry data. CASA volunteers are frequently dismissed by the courts once permanent placement is achieved. Once CASA volunteers are dismissed from a case, they no longer have access to court records related to case closure. Additionally, if a child reenters the CWS, the CASA program does not receive this information unless the new case is referred by the court. Nonetheless, we requested that the state, local, and tribal CASA programs provide reentry data in the CASA Data Request and the OIG survey. The results of the information we received in response to our survey is listed below. \u2022 From the information provided in the CASA Data Request, we found that for the 75,389 CASA cases closed between FYs 2002 and 2004 only 1,073 (1.4 percent) of the children reentered the CWS during that same period. \u2022 From the information provided in the OIG survey, the majority of the respondents (64 percent) estimated that on average for 81 to 100 percent of cases involving a CASA volunteer the child does not reenter the CWS. - xii - Achievement of the Permanent Plan for Reunification or Adoption For each child in the CWS, a permanent plan for the placement of the child is developed. Generally, the permanent plan is either reunification with the parents or adoption. In recent years, to minimize the time a child spends in the CWS, dual permanent plans have been incorporated in most jurisdictions so that a back-up plan runs parallel to the primary plan.17 As result, in these instances either the primary or the back-up permanent plan is generally achieved. Neither the Youngclarke Review nor the Caliber Study included data on whether the permanent plan was achieved. However, both studies included data on case outcomes, including the percentage of cases that resulted in reunification, adoption or other closure. Specifically: \u2022 The Youngclarke Review found that 28 percent of children with a CASA volunteer were adopted as compared to 22 percent of children without a CASA volunteer. Conversely, only 40 percent of children with a CASA volunteer were reunified with their parents as compared to 45 percent of children without a CASA volunteer. \u2022 The Caliber Study found that 11 percent of children with a CASA volunteer were referred for adoption as compared to 5 percent of children without a CASA volunteer. However, 63 percent of children with a CASA volunteer were reunified with their parents as compared to 54 percent of children without a CASA volunteer. HHS does not require state and local CPS agencies to report data on achievement of the permanent plan. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide data on achievement of the permanent plan. However, from the CASA Data Request and OIG Survey we were able to obtain data on outcomes for cases involving a CASA volunteer, including the percentage of cases that resulted in reunification, adoption or other closure, which we compared to the national average for all CPS cases, including CASA cases. Specifically: 17 Dual permanent plans were, in part, the result of the Adoptions and Safe Families Act of 1997, which shortened timelines to encourage the speedy adoption of children for whom reunification or guardianship was not an option. Typically the primary plan is reunification with the parent and the back-up plan is adoption, both of which are pursued in parallel to reduce the time a child is in the system and the time it takes to achieve a permanent plan. - xiii - \u2022 The CASA Data Request found that 19 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were adopted as compared to the national 2004 AFCARS average of 18.2 percent. Additionally, 40.8 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were reunified with their parents as compared to the national 2004 AFCARS average of 54 percent. \u2022 The OIG survey found that respondents estimated that on average 20.7 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were adopted as compared to the national 2005 AFCARS average of 18.2 percent. Additionally, 44.5 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were reunified with their parents as compared to the national 2005 AFCARS average of 54 percent. Based on the available data, we found that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be adopted and less likely to be reunified with their parents than children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. However, this may be because cases involving a CASA volunteer are typically the most serious cases of maltreatment. Therefore, children in these types of cases may be less likely to be reunified with their parents, regardless of whether or not a CASA volunteer was involved. Summary and Conclusion From January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006, NCASAA expended a total of $88.86 million in funds received through OJP grant programs and $14.24 million in funds received from all other sources, including private foundations. NCASAA expended 93.15 percent of its OJP grant funding on activities that directly supported CASA programs. Conversely, NCASAA expended 6.85 percent of its OJP grant funding on general and administrative support activities, which is significantly less than the 16.3 percent average administrative costs for human services non-profit organizations. Additionally, from 1999 through 2006, as a result of an accounting error, NCASAA recorded that it allocated $1.23 million of its OJP grant funds to fundraising activities when, in fact, these funds had not been spent for that purpose. We also found that in 1998 and 1999 NCASAA failed to input a program accounting code identifying the program activity for expenses totaling about $1.5 million. We informed NCASAA of these errors during our review and they have since been corrected. - xiv - With respect to the questions identified by Congress, we found that OJP had established outcome measures for its CASA grant programs. However, the outcome measures established by OJP do not address the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. Additionally, none of the outcome measures established by OJP address the outcome measures mandated for this audit. Further, with the exception of the length of time a child spends in foster care, HHS does not require state and local CPS agencies to report data that specifically addresses the outcome measures mandated by Congress for this audit. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide data that specifically addresses the outcome measures required for this audit. Nonetheless, based on the available data and the results of the OIG survey, we found that in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved: \u2022 the children spent more time in foster care as result of the fact that the children were generally already in foster care before a CASA volunteer was assigned; \u2022 the children and their parents were ordered by the courts to participate in more services and received more services; \u2022 the case was more likely to be \u201cpermanently closed,\u201d (i.e., the children were less likely to reenter the CWS); and \u2022 the children were more likely to be adopted and less likely to be reunified with their parents. Although the outcomes for cases involving a CASA volunteer appear to be less favorable in some instances than cases not involving a CASA volunteer, this may be a result of the fact that cases involving a CASA volunteer are typically the most serious cases of maltreatment. Therefore, children in these types of cases are more likely to: (1) be placed in foster care, (2) require more services, and (3) be adopted rather than reunified with their parents. However, we also found that based on the limited information available, children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were less likely to reenter the CWS after permanent placement was achieved. - xv - Recommendations Our report contains two recommendations that focus on specific steps that OJP should take to improve the CASA grant program. These recommendations include requiring that: \u2022 NCASAA establish a methodology for allocating indirect costs so that federal funds are not charged to unallowable cost categories. \u2022 Outcome-based performance measures are developed for its CASA programs that determine the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. As appropriate, these outcome measures should correspond with the data required by HHS for state and local CPS agencies, so that OJP has a basis for comparing the effectiveness of its CASA grant programs. - xvi - NATIONAL COURT-APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE ASSOCIATION TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ................................................................................ 1 Background ...................................................................................1 National Court-Appointed Special Advocate Association .................... 2 Court-Appointed Special Advocates ............................................... 4 CASA Volunteer Application, Screening, and Selection ...................... 5 CASA Volunteer Training .............................................................. 6 Statistics on Child Abuse in the United States ................................. 6 Legislation ................................................................................. 7 Office of Justice Programs ............................................................ 7 Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention....................... 8 Office for Victims of Crime............................................................ 9 The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System ......................... 9 The Adoption and Foster Care Reporting and Analysis System ......... 10 Prior Reviews ..............................................................................10 FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.............................................. 13 I.

To address this concern, he developed the concept of 1 Pub. L. No. 109-162 (2006) 2 Generally, prior studies of the CASA program and the data tracked by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on children in the state and local child protective services (CPS) system reported on children in out-of-home care rather than children in foster care. The information reported on children in out-of-home care includes all children in foster care, as well as children placed with a relative or legal guardian, who was not a qualified foster parent. Since the prior studies and available HHS data did not include information on only those children in foster care, in this report we considered all children in out-of-home care to be in \u201cfoster care\u201d for the purposes of addressing this objective. 3 All state and local CPS cases are eventually permanently closed because even in those cases for which permanent placement of the child was not achieved, the case is closed when the child reaches the age of majority, is incarcerated, or dies. As a result, for the purposes of this audit we defined permanent closure as those cases that had been closed by CPS, whether due to permanent placement or any other reason, and the child had not reentered the Child Welfare System (CWS) at anytime prior to the date the case data was collected for this audit. 4 For each child in the CWS, a permanent plan for the placement of the child is developed. The permanent plan outlines what will happen to the child upon resolution of the cases. Generally, the permanent plan is either reunification with the parents or adoption. - 1 - recruiting and training community volunteers to represent the best interest of a child in court proceedings. In 1977, the first CASA pilot program was implemented in Seattle. The purpose of the CASA program is to ensure that abused and neglected children receive high-quality, sensitive, effective, and timely representation in court hearings to determine their guardianship. In 1978, the National Center for State Courts selected the Seattle CASA program as the best national example of citizens participating in juvenile justice, resulting in the replication of the program in courts across the country. By 1982, it was clear that a national association was needed to coordinate the 54 existing state and local CASA programs and provide training and technical assistance. National Court-Appointed Special Advocate Association In 1984, NCASAA, the national headquarters for CASA programs was opened in Seattle. According to NCASAA\u2019s web site, together with its state and local members, its mission \u201cis to support and promote court-appointed special advocacy for abused and neglected children so they can thrive in safe, permanent homes.\u201d NCASAA provides leadership, training, technical assistance, and subgrants to CASA programs across the country. Additionally, NCASAA stages an annual conference, promotes CASA programs through public awareness efforts, and provides counseling and other resources to help start up new programs and to provide vital assistance to existing programs. The state, local, and tribal CASA programs are responsible for recruiting, training, and supporting volunteers in advocating for abused and neglected children. At the time NCASAA was incorporated, there were 107 state and local CASA programs in 26 states.5 As of 2005, there were 948 state, local, and tribal CASA programs in 49 states that served an estimated 226,204 children. 6 As shown in Figure 1, CASA program coverage varies from state to state. 5 These programs include both CASA volunteers and guardian ad litem (GAL) volunteers, who are generally lawyers appointed by the court to represent children in abuse or neglect cases. A CASA volunteer may also be a GAL or work in conjunction with a GAL. 6 North Dakota is the only state with a CASA program that is not a member of NCASAA because it uses paid advocates rather than volunteers. - 2 - FIGURE 1. PERCENTAGES OF COUNTIES SERVED BY CASA PROGRAMS Source: Youngclarke Review7 According to the NCASAA Annual Local Program Survey for 2005, an estimated 226,204 children were served by an estimated 53,847 volunteers, as shown in Table 1.

Other states detail the roles and responsibilities of the CASA volunteers, their qualifications and training, and their rights and powers. However, a number of states provide greater discretion to the local courts. The most common differences among states involve the role and formal status of the volunteer, the forms of attorney representation, the formal relationship between the volunteer and the attorney for the child, and types of cases accepted. There are five general activities associated with the role of a CASA volunteer: \u2022 Fact finding and information gathering - CASA volunteers meet with and interview everyone connected with the child. They frequently visit with and observe the child, visit the homes of the child and the parent, contact caseworkers, and review case records. These activities help the advocates gain insight into what is best for a child, what kinds of services might be helpful, and what support is needed to move toward achieving the permanent plan. \u2022 Legal representation - These activities must be performed by a CASA volunteer who is a licensed attorney. The activities include appearances at hearings, filing motions and other legal papers, and advising the child on legal issues. In this role, the CASA volunteer may make recommendations to the court regarding the permanent plan for placement of the child, services to be provided, and visitation issues. \u2022 Negotiation and mediation - The CASA volunteer develops agreements and conditions between the parties as they pertain to the welfare of the child. \u2022 Case monitoring - The CASA volunteer maintains contact with the child and other relevant parties, monitors the child\u2019s special needs, and follows up on court orders. \u2022 Resource brokering \u2013 The CASA volunteer works in the community to help children and their parents to obtain needed services. - 4 - Regardless of the parameters of the CASA volunteer\u2019s activities within the court system, NCASAA has provided some guiding principles that help ensure the quality of the advocacy. Volunteers: \u2022 must have access to legal support; \u2022 must be independent; \u2022 should be appointed to the case at the earliest possible time; \u2022 should receive notice of all hearings, staffing, and other case conferences related to the child; \u2022 should have complete access to all information related to the child and the child\u2019s situation; and \u2022 should have immunity from liability for performing their role in a responsible manner. CASA Volunteer Application, Screening, and Selection According to NCASAA\u2019s standards, all applicants who want to become CASA volunteers are required to:8 \u2022 Complete a written application concerning education, training, employment, and experience in working with children. \u2022 Submit three references, of which two must not be related to the applicant. \u2022 Authorize federal, state, and local criminal, sex offender, and child neglect and abuse checks. \u2022 Participate in interviews with program personnel. To become a CASA volunteer, applicants must be at least 21 years of age and have successfully passed the application and screening process. Before volunteers are assigned to a case, all screening must be completed with written verification on file at the program office. 8 NCASAA, Standards for Local CASA/GAL Programs, 2006. - 5 - CASA Volunteer Training State, local, and tribal CASA programs train volunteers using the NCASAA\u2019s national training curriculum or its equivalent. Training consists of 30 hours of required pre-service training and 12 hours of required annual in-service training. Additionally, if the court served by the CASA program allows, volunteers are required to observe an in-session abuse or neglect proceeding before appearing in court for an assigned case. Statistics on Child Abuse in the United States According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in fiscal year (FY) 2004 an estimated 3 million children were alleged to have been neglected or abused and were the subject of investigation or assessment by state or local child protective services (CPS) agencies.9 Additionally, in FY 2004: \u2022 Approximately 872,000 children were identified as victims of maltreatment. \u2022 An estimated 1,490 children died as a result of child abuse or neglect. \u2022 More than 80 percent of the children who died were 4 years old or younger. An HHS report, The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) Report No. 13, Preliminary FY 2005 Estimates, September 2006 (2005 AFCARS Report), estimated that as of September 30, 2005:10 \u2022 An estimated 513,000 children were in foster care. \u2022 The average age of children in foster care was 10 years old and the average length of stay in foster care was 28.6 months. \u2022 118,000 children were waiting adoption. 9 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children, Youth and Families, Children\u2019s Bureau, Child Maltreatment 2004, (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2006). 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children, Youth and Families, Children\u2019s Bureau, The AFCARS Report No.13, Preliminary FY 2005 Estimates, September 2006. - 6 - Further, according to the 2005 AFCARS report, in FY 2005 approximately 311,000 children entered foster care, while 287,000 exited foster care. Legislation Over the past 32 years, Congress has enacted the following legislation related to protecting children from abuse and neglect. \u2022 In 1974, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) formally recognized the importance of providing independent representatives for children in court proceedings by mandating that each child have a guardian ad litem. \u2022 The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 mandated a greater emphasis on ensuring that permanent placement is achieved for children in foster care and required that every 6 months juvenile and family courts review all cases involving abused or neglected children. \u2022 CAPTA was amended by the Child Abuse Prevention, Adoption and Family Services Act of 1988. This Act directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a national data collection and analysis program, which became The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, for state child abuse and neglect reports. \u2022 The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 required that \u201ca CASA shall be available to every victim of child abuse or neglect in the United States that needs such an advocate.\u201d \u2022 CAPTA was amended in 1996 mandating that states seeking federal funding under the Act must create citizen review panels, which provide citizen oversight to ensure attainment of state goals for protecting children from abuse and neglect. \u2022 The Adoptions and Safe Families Act of 1997 shortened timelines to encourage the speedy adoption of children for whom reunification or guardianship is not an option. Office of Justice Programs Since 1984, DOJ Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has worked to improve the juvenile justice systems and assist crime victims. The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990, as amended, authorized the OJP Office of - 7 - Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to administer a newly created CASA grant program. The OJP Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) also provides funding through the Tribal Court CASA Program, which assists in developing and enhancing programs that provide volunteer advocacy for abused or neglected Native American children. Additionally, CASA programs are also eligible to receive Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funding at the state level, which provides support services to crime victims. OJP partners with the NCASAA to administer the CASA program and provide funding, training, and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal CASA programs. Since 1993, OJP has awarded NCASAA 15 grants totaling $100.4 million, including 12 OJJDP grants totaling $98.52 million, and 3 OVC grants totaling $1.88 million, as shown in Table 2. TABLE 2.

OJJDP supports states and communities in their efforts to develop and implement effective and coordinated prevention and intervention programs, and to improve the juvenile justice system so that it protects public safety, holds offenders accountable, and provides treatment - 8 - and rehabilitative services tailored to the needs of juveniles and their families. Additionally, OJJDP administers the distribution of grants to the CASA program, authorized by the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990, as amended, which directs that a CASA shall be available to every victim of child abuse or neglect if needed. As stated previously, OJP partners with NCASAA to administer the distribution of grants to the CASA program. Since 1993, OJJDP has awarded NCASAA 12 grants totaling $98.52 million. In turn, NCASAA uses a portion of this funding to provide subawards to state, local, and tribal CASA programs on a competitive basis. The subgrants awarded by NCASAA are used for: (1) new program development, (2) expansion programs, (3) state organizations, (4) urban program demonstration, and (5) increasing the diversity of CASA staff and volunteers to better meet the needs of children from diverse communities. In awarding subgrants, NCASAA stated that it emphasizes increasing the availability of advocates in communities where existing services do not meet the needs of families and children. Office for Victims of Crime The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) was formally established in 1988 as a result of an amendment to the 1984 Victims of Crime Act. OVC provides leadership and funding on behalf of crime victims. In addition, OVC provides funding for the Tribal Court CASA Program mentioned previously, which is also administered by NCASAA. Since 1993, OVC has awarded NCASAA three grants totaling $1.88 million. CASA programs are also eligible to receive Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funding at the state level. VOCA victim assistance grant funds support services to victims of crime. However, not all children represented by a CASA volunteer are victims of crime. The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System The 1988 amendment to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act directed HHS to establish a national data collection and analysis program through its Children\u2019s Bureau in the Administration for Children, Youth and Families. The data is then input into the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS). The NCANDS collects case-level data on all children who are involved in an investigation or assessment by a CPS agency. The data are submitted voluntarily, and used for an annual Child Maltreatment report, which is published each spring. In addition, data are used in several efforts by the Children's Bureau to measure the impact and effectiveness of CPS agencies. The NCANDS data includes information on: - 9 - \u2022 the characteristics of referrals of abuse or neglect that are made to CPS agencies, \u2022 the types of maltreatment that are alleged, \u2022 the dispositions (or findings) of the investigations, \u2022 the risk factors of the child and the caregivers, \u2022 the services that are provided, and \u2022 the perpetrators. The Adoption and Foster Care Reporting and Analysis System The HHS Adoption and Foster Care Reporting and Analysis System (AFCARS) collects case-level information for placement, care, or supervision on all children in foster care for whom the state CWS agencies are responsible. In addition, AFCARS contains data on children who are adopted under the auspices of the state's CWS. States are required to submit AFCARS data semi-annually to the HHS\u2019 Administration for Children, Youth and Families. The semi-annual AFCARS reports cover the periods October 1 through March 31, and April 1 through September 30. The AFCARS report provides information on the: \u2022 number of children in foster care, \u2022 number of children who entered foster care that year, \u2022 number of children who exited foster care that year, \u2022 number of children awaiting adoption at year end and months in foster care, \u2022 number of children in foster care with parental rights terminated and the months since parental rights were terminated, and \u2022 number of children adopted with public agency involvement. Prior Reviews Since inception of NCASAA in 1982, over 70 reviews, studies, and surveys of the CASA program have been conducted by a wide range of institutions, agencies, individuals, or other organizations. Out of the 70 prior reports, we identified two studies of the CASA program that in our judgment - 10 - provided the most comprehensive and current information related to the outcome objectives mandated by Congress for this audit. \u2022 Youngclarke, Ramos, and Granger-Merkle, A Systematic Review of the Impact of Court-Appointed Special Advocates, 2004 (Youngclarke Review). The Youngclarke Review summarized the findings of 20 prior studies that assessed the impact of CASA programs. In conducting the review, almost 70 prior studies of CASA programs were analyzed, but only 20 met the criteria for inclusion in the Youngclarke Review.11 The review compares the combined average outcome measures reported in the prior studies for cases involving a CASA volunteer to those for which a CASA volunteer was not appointed. \u2022 Caliber Associates, Evaluation of CASA Representation, 2004, (Caliber Study).12 The Caliber Study combines data from the NCASAA\u2019s management information systems and data collected through the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a federally sponsored national survey of children and their families. The study compares outcome measures for cases involving a CASA volunteer to those for which a CASA volunteer was not appointed. The results reported in the Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study that pertain to the objectives of this audit are discussed in the Findings and Recommendations sections of this report. In addition to the Youngclarke Review and the Caliber Study, we identified two surveys that provided useful information in understanding the relationship between CASA volunteers and judges, attorneys, child welfare workers, and both biological and adoptive parents. While these surveys do not speak directly to the audit objectives, they provide useful insight into the effectiveness of CASA programs. 11 Although the findings of 20 previous studies on CASA programs were included in the Youngclarke Review, none of the studies addressed all of the measurement outcomes. Therefore, the summary data for each outcome measure is based on a different number of studies and occasionally includes different studies altogether. Additionally, the outcome measures summarized in the Youngclarke Review are separated into two categories: the combined-all category, which includes all studies with relevant data, and the combined-levels 1 and 2 category, which includes only those studies that were determined to have the strongest levels of evidence ratings. For the purposes of this report we only used the summary outcome measures reported for the combined-level 1 and 2 category because the studies included in this analysis were determined to have the highest levels of evidence. 12 It should be noted that the Caliber Study was funded in part by NCASAA. Funding was also provided by the Packard Foundation. - 11 - \u2022 Pat Litzelfelner, Ph.D., University of Kentucky, College of Social Work, National CASA Consumer Satisfaction Survey, September 2003. This study found that judges and attorneys in the CWS expressed the highest overall satisfaction with CASA programs. Additionally, both the biological parents and the foster parents spoke highly of the CASA volunteers. \u2022 Organizational Research Services, Evaluation of Court-Appointed Special Advocates/Guardians Ad Litem Volunteer Impact, September 2005 (Organizational Research Services Study). This study found that CASA volunteers: (1) are very effective in supporting court processes through a wide range of activities, (2) perform activities that have been very useful in making decisions concerning case outcomes, (3) tend to be assigned to the most difficult cases, and (4) provide recommendations that are frequently incorporated into court orders. - 12 - FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I. ACTIVITIES FUNDED BY NCASAA SINCE 1993 We found that NCASAA did not retain any accounting records or supporting documentation for expenditures occurring prior to 1995. Additionally, although NCASAA retained some of the accounting records and supporting documentation for 1995 through 1997, the information was incomplete. According to federal regulations, NCASAA was not required to retain accounting records related to grant expenditures for these periods. Because the accounting information for these periods was not retained, we are unable to provide information on the activities funding by NCASAA from calendar years 1993 through 1997. However, from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006, NCASAA expended a total of $88.86 million in funds received through OJP grant programs and $14.24 million in funds received from non-federal sources. NCASAA expended 93.15 percent of its OJP grant funding on activities that directly supported CASA programs. Conversely, only 6.85 percent of its OJP grant funding was for general and administrative support activities, which is significantly less than the 16.3 percent average administrative costs for human services non-profit organizations.13 To determine the types of activities funded by NCASAA since 1993, we requested that NCASAA provide accounting data from January 1, 1993, through June 30, 2006, for all expenditures from both federal and private funding sources. We found that NCASAA did not retain any accounting records or supporting documentation for expenditures occurring prior to 1995. Additionally, although NCASAA retained some of the accounting records and supporting documentation for 1995 through 1997, the information was incomplete. According to federal regulations (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 70) grantees are only required to retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to Department of Justice grants for a period of 3 years from the date of submission of the final financial report. Because, NCASAA was not required to and did not retain the accounting records and supporting documentation 13 Thomas H. Pollak and Mark Hager, The Urban Institute, and Patrick Rooney, Indiana University, \u201cUnderstanding Management and General Expenses of Non-profits,\u201d an Overhead Cost Study Working Paper presented at the 2001 Annual Meeting of the Association for Research on Non-profit Organizations and Voluntary Actions, New Orleans, LA, 2001 (Pollak and Hager, 2001). - 13 - for its expenditures occurring prior to 1998, we cannot provide information regarding activities funded by NCASAA prior to that time in this report. However, we were able to obtain information related to the activities funded by NCASAA from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006. Table 3 illustrates the activities funded by NCASAA during this period from both federal and non-federal funding sources. TABLE 3.

NCASAA expended $82.77 million (93.15 percent) of its OJP grant funding on activities that directly supported CASA programs. The direct activities funded by NCASAA include: \u2022 $57.16 million (64.33 percent) on awards to subgrantees to support state and local CASA programs, \u2022 $13.63 million (15.34 percent) on training and technical assistance for state and local CASA programs, and 14 The amounts reported in this table reflect the activities funded by NCASAA as determined by our audit. 15 Differences in total amounts are due to rounding, e.g., the sum of individual numbers prior to rounding may differ from the sum of the individual numbers rounded. - 14 - \u2022 $11.98 million (13.48 percent) on membership and public outreach. We also found that NCASAA expended $12.36 million (86.80 percent) of its funding from all non-federal sources on activities that directly supported CASA programs. Further, NCASAA only expended about $1 million on fundraising activities, which was 6.81 percent of its funding from all non-federal sources. During our review of the accounting records, we found that from 1999 through 2006, NCASAA erroneously recorded that it had allocated $1.23 million of its OJP grant funds to fundraising activities. Table 4 illustrates the OJP grant funds that were erroneously recorded. TABLE 4. AMOUNTS ERRONEOUSLY RECORDED AS ALLOCATED TO FUNDRAISING CALENDAR YEAR 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 TOTAL AMOUNT $ 74,710 79,240 86,659 147,608 219,626 289,113 223,653 110,556 $1,231,165 Source: NCASAA general ledgers Based on our review of NCASAA\u2019s accounting records and supporting documentation, we determined the $1.23 million recorded as spent on fundraising was the result of an accounting error and that these funds were spent on other program activities. Therefore, NCASAA did not use OJP grant funds for fundraising activities. We informed NCASAA of the error during our review, and it has since been corrected for 2006. Nonetheless, we are recommending that OJP ensure that NCASAA establishes a methodology for allocating indirect costs so that federal funds are not charged to unallowable cost categories in the future. We also found that in 1998 and 1999 NCASAA failed to input a program accounting code identifying the program activity for expenses totaling about $1.5 million. We informed NCASAA of the error during our review, and these amounts have since been reallocated to the appropriate program activities. - 15 - Indirect Activities Funded by NCASAA As shown previously in Table 3, we found that NCASAA expended $6.09 million (6.85 percent) of its OJP grant funding and only $1.88 million (13.20 percent) of its funding from all non-federal sources on general and administrative support activities. NCASAA expended a total of $7.97 million (7.73 percent) of its total funding on general and administrative costs. As a result, over 90 percent of the funding received by NCASAA is expended on activities that directly supported CASA programs. We found that NCASAA\u2019s costs related to general and administrative support activities are significantly less than average administrative costs for human services non-profit organizations. As shown in Table 5, according to Pollak and Hager, 2001, the average percentage of funds expended on indirect activities for human services non-profit organizations and all non-profit organizations were 16.3 percent and 18.1 percent respectively.

Table 6 illustrates the types of grant programs funded by NCASAA through subawards of OJP funding. - 16 - TABLE 6.

Table 7 illustrates the subgrantee expenditures of OJP funding received through NCASAA subgrants. - 17 - TABLE 7.

Recommendation We recommend that OJP: 1. Ensures that NCASAA establishes a methodology for allocating indirect costs so that federal funds are not charged to unallowable cost categories. 16 The differences between the total subgrantee expenditures shown in Table 7 and the total NCASAA subawards shown in Table 6 resulted from the fact that some of the subgrants were still open at the time of our review and not all of the funding had been expended. - 18 - II. OUTCOMES FOR CASA CASES COMPARED TO NON-CASA CASES We found that OJP had established outcome measures for its CASA grant programs. However, the outcome measures established by OJP do not address the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS or the outcome measures identified by Congress. Further, with the exception of the length of time a child spends in foster care, HHS and NCASAA do not report on data that specifically addresses the outcome measures identified by Congress for this audit. Nonetheless, based on the available data and the results of an OIG survey, we found that in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved: (1) children spent more time in foster care as result of the fact that the children were generally already in foster care before a CASA volunteer was assigned; (2) children and their parents were ordered by the courts to participate in more services and received more services; (3) the case was more likely to be \u201cpermanently closed,\u201d i.e., the children were less likely to reenter the CPS system; and (4) children were more likely to be adopted and less likely to be reunified with their parents. Although the outcomes for cases involving a CASA volunteer appear to be less favorable in some instances than cases not involving a CASA volunteer, this may be a result of the fact that cases involving a CASA volunteer typically involve the most serious cases of maltreatment. As stated previously, Congress directed the OIG to examine the outcomes in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved, including: \u2022 the length of time a child spends in foster care; \u2022 the extent to which there is an increased provision of services; \u2022 the percentage of cases permanently closed; and \u2022 achievement of the permanent plan for reunification or adoption. We found that with the exception of the length of time a child spends in foster care, HHS does not require state and local CPS programs to report data that specifically addresses the outcome measures mandated by Congress for this audit. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide data that specifically addresses the outcome - 19 - measures required for this audit. As a result, although we obtained data for the state and local CASA programs that we used to address the audit objectives, we were not always able to obtain comparison data for cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. We also found that OJP had established outcome measures for its CASA grant programs. However, the outcome measures established by OJP do not address the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. Additionally, none of the outcome measures established by OJP address the outcome measures mandated for this audit. In our judgment, OJP should develop outcome performance measures for the CASA grant programs to determine the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. As appropriate, these outcome measures should correspond with the data required by HHS for state and local CPS agencies, so that OJP has a basis for comparing the effectiveness of its CASA grant programs. Additionally, at any point in time only a small percentage of the participating state, local, and tribal CASA programs have open subgrants of OJP grant funding awarded by NCASAA. For those CASA programs that do not have subgrants, NCASAA can request, but not require, that they provide outcome data. Nonetheless, for its 2005 Annual Program Survey, NCASAA received data on children from 90 percent of its CASA program members. Because of the lack of data on the objectives for this audit, to determine the outcomes in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved, we relied on the following: \u2022 prior studies of the NCASAA program, including the Youngclarke Review and the Caliber Study, which we felt provided the most comprehensive and current information related to the objectives mandated by Congress; \u2022 data from the state and local CASA program case-tracking databases (CASA Data Request), which we compared to national data maintained by HHS; \u2022 data from an OIG survey distributed to all state, local, and tribal CASA program offices; and - 20 - \u2022 the most recent AFCARS data available at the time our analysis was conducted on all children in the state and local CPS for comparison purposes.17 For the CASA Data Request, NCASAA distributed our request for data on the four outcome measures from the case management systems to 731 state, local, and tribal CASA programs. We received data related to time in foster care, permanent case closure, and the case outcomes including adoption and reunification from 192 respondents representing 339 programs. However, we generally did not receive data on the number of services ordered by the courts and received by children and their parents because it was not generally tracked in the case management systems. Additionally, we distributed a nationwide survey to state, local, and tribal CASA programs offices requesting information on the four outcome measures, as well as additional information on the: (1) basis for the responses related to the four outcome measures in our survey, (2) effectiveness of NCASAA, and (3) data reported in the Caliber Study, which was the most recent study available related to the outcome measures. Out of the 945 CASA programs to which the OIG survey was sent, we received 491 responses. The consolidated results of the OIG survey are detailed in Appendix II. Length of Time in Foster Care We found that the length of time a child spends in foster care is longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. As shown in Table 8, the Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study found that the average length of time a child spends in foster care is between 3.9 months and 1.5 months longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer. TABLE 8. LENGTH OF TIME IN FOSTER CARE PRIOR STUDIES TIME IN FOSTER CARE (MONTHS) STUDY Youngclarke Review Caliber Study CASA 23.9 10.2 NON-CASA 20.0 8.7 Source: Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study DIFFERENCE FOR CASA + 3.9 + 1.5 17 It should be noted that HHS does not collect separate data on CASA cases, rather the AFCARS data includes all CASA and non-CASA cases related to children in the state and local CPS. - 21 - It should be noted that both the Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study concluded that there was no significant difference in the length of time a child spends in foster care for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. Based on the results of the CASA Data Request and the OIG survey, we also found that the length of time a child spends in foster care is longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to the national average for all CPS cases, including CASA cases.18 As shown in Table 9, based on the CASA Data Request and the OIG survey average length of time a child spends in foster care is between 2 months and 1.2 months longer for cases involving a CASA volunteer than the national average for all CPS cases. TABLE 9.

Types of Cases According to the Caliber Study, cases assigned to a CASA volunteer frequently involve the most serious cases of maltreatment and the children 18 For the CASA program case system data request and the OIG survey, we used the weighted average of the length of time a child spends in foster care where a CASA volunteer is involved. 19 For the CASA Data Request, we compared the weighted average of the length of time a child spends in foster care where a CASA volunteer is involved to the 2004 AFCARS data which was the most recent data available at the time our analysis was conducted. It should be noted that AFCARS data includes all CASA and non-CASA cases related to children in the state and local CPS. For the OIG survey, we compared the weighted average of the length of time a child spends in foster care where a CASA volunteer is involved to the 2005 AFCARS data. 20 The weighted average number of months in foster care that was calculated for the OIG survey is based on the number of respondents rather than children. - 22 - were more at risk. As a result, for the majority of cases involving a CASA volunteer, the child was placed in foster care much more frequently than for cases not referred to a CASA program, as shown in Table 10. TABLE 10. PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE CASE STATUS Closed Cases Open Cases Source: Caliber Study PERCENT OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE WITH CASA VOLUNTEER 89% 100% WITHOUT CASA VOLUNTEER 18% 45% As shown in Table 10, the Caliber Study indicates that for closed cases, children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were almost 5 times more likely to be placed in foster care as compared to children in cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. Further, for open cases, children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more than twice as likely to be placed in foster care than children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. The Caliber Study also cited the Calkins and Millar Study, which they felt contained the strongest study methodology related to this outcome measure because the sample was based on CASA and non-CASA children who were equivalent in the severity of their abuse histories.21 Additionally, the Calkins and Millar Study included only those children for which a CASA volunteer was assigned early in the case. The Calkins and Millar Study found that for children with similar case histories, the children in cases involving a CASA volunteer spent on average 31 months in foster care as compared to 40 months for children in cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. The Calkins and Millar Study concluded that there was a significant reduction in the length of time in foster care (9 months) for cases involving a CASA volunteer. Finally, The Organizational Research Services Study also concluded there is a general consensus (over 80 percent of respondents) that judges tend to assign the most difficult cases to CASA volunteers. 21 Calkins, Cynthia A. & Murray Millar. \u201cThe Effectiveness of Court Appointed Special Advocates to Assist in Permanency Planning,\u201d Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal, Vol. 16, #1, February 1999, pp. 37-45 (Calkins Millar Study). - 23 - Time in Foster Care Prior to Assignment of a CASA Volunteer Based on the results of the OIG survey, we found that the majority of respondents (51 percent) estimated that on average 81 to 100 percent of the children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were placed in foster care at some time while in the CWS. Additionally, the majority of respondents (54 percent) estimated that on average 81 to 100 percent of the children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were placed in foster care prior to the time that the case was referred to the CASA program office by the court, as shown in Table 11.

As shown in Table 12, based on the results of the CASA Data Request, we determined that for cases involving a CASA volunteer, the child was in foster care on average 15.8 months while in the CWS. However, the child was in foster care on average 10.3 months during the time that a CASA volunteer was assigned to the case. - 24 - TABLE 12.

The OIG survey also asked that the CASA program offices provide information related to the length of time children were in foster care from the day they entered the CWS until a CASA volunteer was assigned and from that point forward. As shown in Table 13, based on the results of the OIG survey, we determined that for cases involving a CASA volunteer, the child was in foster care on average 4.5 months prior to being assigned a CASA volunteer and 12.7 months after a CASA volunteer was assigned. - 25 - TABLE 13.

OF RESPONDENTS) 37 156 146 51 18 408 12.3 MONTHS According to NCASAA management, reducing the amount of time in foster care is generally considered a favorable outcome. However, the actual placement outcome, i.e., adoption, reunification, permanent placement with a relative, emancipation, and guardianship, is more critical. However, NCASAA management believes that if necessary, it is better for a child to spend more time in foster care than risk a poor permanent placement. Additionally, the respondents to the OIG survey who stated that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be placed in foster care, based their conclusion on the fact that the children were already in foster care prior to being referred to the CASA program. Further, the respondents who stated that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be in foster care longer based their conclusion on the fact that volunteers focus on achieving permanency. Therefore, the primary focus is on a successful permanent placement, rather than on closing the case as quickly as possible. Increased Provision of Services According to NCASAA, a significant factor in determining a final placement outcome involves the availability and effectiveness of services for both the child and the parents. One of the duties of a CASA volunteer is to make recommendations to the court of services needed for both children and their parents. Examples of services ordered by the court for children include mental health, medical treatment, and training in independent living if children are close to the age of majority. Services ordered by the court for parents also include mental health, drug, and alcohol treatment, as well as training on basic health and domestic violence. - 26 - The Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study both included the number of services ordered for children and the parents of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases not involving a CASA volunteer. This information was obtained from actual CASA, CPS, and court case files and through interviews of CASA and CPS officials. Based on the Youngclarke Review and the Caliber Study, on average between 2.1 and 3.1 additional services were ordered by the court for children and the parents of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer, as shown in Table 14. TABLE 14. NUMBER OF SERVICES ORDERED FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS STUDY OR SURVEY Youngclarke Review Caliber Study NUMBER OF SERVICES ORDERED CASA 9.0 19.1 NON-CASA 6.9 16.0 DIFFERENCE FOR CASA + 2.1 + 3.1 Source: Youngclarke Review, Caliber Study, OIG survey Based on the Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study, for cases involving a CASA volunteer, significantly more services on average were ordered by the court for children and their parents. In our judgment, this is an indication that the CASA program is effective in identifying the needs of children and parents in the CWS. The Caliber Study also reported on the types of services and percentage of services received by children and their parents for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to non-CASA cases. The Caliber Study found that, mental health and medical services were significantly more likely to be received by children in cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases not involving a CASA volunteer. This may be an indication that the types of cases referred to CASA programs involve the most serious types of maltreatment. Additionally, the Caliber Study found that services in the areas of health care, alcohol and drug, legal, and family support were significantly more likely to be received by parents of children with a CASA volunteer than those without one. This may also be an indication that the types of cases referred to CASA programs involve the most serious types of maltreatment. The number of services ordered for children and the parents of children in the CWS is not an outcome that is generally tracked by state, local, and tribal CASA programs in their case management systems. Therefore, we were unable to obtain sufficient data related to this outcome measure from the CASA Data Request. - 27 - Based on the OIG survey, we found that on average 8.1 services were ordered for the children and parents of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer. However, HHS does not require state and local CPS programs to report data on the number of services ordered. As a result, we were unable to compare the information we obtained from the OIG survey to the national average. In the OIG survey, 95 percent of the respondents stated that more services were ordered for children in cases involving a CASA volunteer. The general comment provided by the respondents as to why more services were ordered was that the attention and time the volunteers spend with the children allows them to better identify the services needed. Additionally, in the OIG survey 89 percent of the respondents stated that more services were ordered for parents of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer. The general comment provided by the respondents as to why more services were ordered was that it is in the best interest of the child to have more services provided to parents in order for there to be a successful reunification. Percentage of Cases Permanently Closed All state and local CPS cases are eventually permanently closed, even those cases for which permanent placement of the child was not achieved, when the child reaches the age of majority, is incarcerated, or dies. As a result, for the purposes of this audit we defined permanent closure as those cases that had been closed for any reason and the child had not reentered the CWS at anytime prior to the date the case data was collected. The Youngclarke Review found that cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be \u201cpermanently closed\u201d as compared to cases not involving a CASA volunteer. Specifically, the review found that only 9 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer reentered the CWS as compared to 16 percent of children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. The Caliber Study did not provide data on the percentage of children included in the study who reentered the CWS, rather the study included data on the number of cases for which subsequent allegations of abuse were reported. The Caliber Study found that: \u2022 Subsequent allegations of abuse were reported for 36 percent of the closed cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to 25 percent of the closed cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. - 28 - \u2022 Conversely, subsequent allegations of abuse were reported for only 34 percent of the open cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to 52 percent of the open cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. However, it should be noted that the Caliber Study did not determine whether the subsequent allegations of abuse were substantiated. Further, the Caliber Study concluded that there was no significant difference in the subsequent allegations of abuse reported for children in cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases not involving a CASA volunteer. HHS does not require state and local CPS agencies to report data on reentry into the CWS. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide reentry data. Further, CASA volunteers are frequently dismissed by the courts once permanent placement is achieved. Once CASA volunteers are dismissed from a case, they no longer have access to court records related to case closure. Additionally, if the child reenters the CWS, the CASA program does not receive this information unless the new case is referred by the court. Nonetheless, we requested the state, local, and tribal CASA programs provide reentry data from their case management systems on cases that were closed during FYs 2002 through 2004, for children in cases involving a CASA volunteer who had reentered the CWS after case closure. Based on the information provided in the CASA Data Request, we found that for the 75,389 CASA cases closed during FYs 2002 through 2004, only 1,073 (1.4 percent) of the children reentered the CWS during that same period. Based on the OIG survey, we found that 76 percent of the respondents stated that in cases involving a CASA volunteer, the children are less likely to reenter the CWS for the following reasons: \u2022 the volunteers ensure proper and permanent placement, and \u2022 the needed services are provided and requirements are met. We found that 4 percent of the respondents in the OIG survey stated that in cases involving a CASA volunteer, the children are more likely to reenter the CWS for the following reasons: \u2022 CASA volunteers continue to monitor cases and keep in touch with children so they know if and when children should be removed from the parents again, and \u2022 CASA volunteers are dealing with high-risk cases. - 29 - Finally, we found that 20 percent of the OIG survey respondents stated that in cases involving a CASA volunteer, the children are as likely to reenter the CWS for the following reasons: \u2022 relapses by parents and their inability to change, and \u2022 CASA volunteers stay in contact and often monitor the cases after they have been closed. Based on the Youngclarke Review and our analysis of the information obtained from the CASA Data Request and OIG survey, it appears that cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be \u201cpermanently closed.\u201d Achievement of Permanent Plan For each child in the CWS, a permanent plan for the placement of the child is developed. Generally, the permanent plan is either reunification with the parents or adoption. In recent years, to minimize the time a child spends in the CWS, dual permanent plans have been incorporated in most jurisdictions so that a back-up plan runs parallel to the primary plan. Dual permanent plans were in part the result of the Adoptions and Safe Families Act of 1997, which shortened timelines to encourage the speedy adoption of children for whom reunification or guardianship was not an option. Typically the primary plan is reunification with the parent and the back-up plan is adoption, both of which are pursued in parallel to reduce the time the child is in the system and the time it takes to achieve a permanent plan. Additionally, the permanent plan changes over time as conditions and circumstances change. For instance, the plan for an older child may change from reunification with the parents to independent living based on the length of time the child is in the CWS. As a result, in most instances the permanent plan is generally achieved. Neither the Youngclarke Review nor the Caliber Study included data on whether the permanent plan was achieved. However, both studies contained information on the percentage of cases that resulted in reunification, adoption or other closure. As shown in Table 15, based on the Youngclarke Review and the Caliber Study, children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be adopted than children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. - 30 - TABLE 15. COMPARISON OF ADOPTION OUTCOMES ADOPTION NON-CASA 22% 5% ADOPTION WITH CASA 28% Youngclarke Review Caliber Study22 11% Source: Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study STUDY DIFFERENCE WITH CASA + 6% + 6% However, as shown in Table 16, based on the Youngclarke Review, children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were less likely to be to be reunified with their parents, than children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. Conversely, based on the Caliber Study, children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be to be reunified with their parents, than children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer.

COMPARISON OF REUNIFICATION OUTCOMES STUDY Youngclarke Review Caliber Study Source: Youngclarke Review and Caliber Study REUNIFIED WITH CASA 40% 63% REUNIFIED NON-CASA 45% 54% DIFFERENCE WITH CASA - 5% + 9% Based on the available data shown in Tables 15 and 16, we found that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be adopted. However, this may be because cases involving a CASA volunteer are typically the most serious cases of maltreatment. Therefore, children in these types of cases may be more likely to be adopted, regardless of whether or not a CASA volunteer was involved. HHS does not require state and local CPS agencies to report data on achievement of the permanent plan. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide data on achievement of the permanent plan. However, from the CASA Data Request and the OIG Survey we were able to obtain data on outcomes for cases involving a CASA volunteer, including the percentage of cases that resulted in reunification, adoption or other closure, which we compared to the national average for all CPS cases, including CASA cases. Specifically: \u2022 The CASA Data Request found that 19 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were adopted as compared to the national 22 The Caliber Study only compared the outcomes for cases involving a CASA volunteer as compared to cases not involving a CASA volunteer for children who had been placed in foster care. There was no outcome data reported for children who had not been placed in foster care. - 31 - 2004 AFCARS average of 18.2 percent. Additionally, 40.8 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were reunified with their parents as compared to the national 2004 AFCARS average of 54 percent. \u2022 The OIG survey found that respondents estimated that on average 20.7 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were adopted as compared to the national 2005 AFCARS average of 18.2 percent. Additionally, 44.5 percent of children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were reunified with their parents as compared to the national 2005 AFCARS average of 54 percent. In the CASA Data Request, we asked all programs nationwide to report on the outcomes for children exiting the system during FY 2004. As shown in Table 17, we compared the outcomes reported in the CASA Data Request to those reported in the 2004 AFCARS report for all cases. TABLE 17.

The general comment provided by the respondents was that if reunification is not possible, adoption is sought since the goal is permanent placement of the child. We also found that 40 percent of the respondents to the OIG survey stated that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were as likely to be adopted as children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. The general comment provided by the respondents was that children are as likely to be 23 The \u201cOther\u201d category includes: living with a relative (other than a legal guardian), a runaway, or the death of the child. - 32 - adopted because CASA volunteers push for permanency, and adoption is a permanent solution. Finally, 11 percent of the respondents to the OIG survey stated that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were less likely to be adopted than children in cases not involving a CASA volunteer for the following reasons: \u2022 The number one goal of CASA volunteers is reunification and it is usually achieved. \u2022 When reunification is not possible, permanent placement with a relative other than the parent is utilized. Additionally, in the OIG survey, we found that 34 percent of the respondents stated that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were more likely to be reunited with their family than in cases not involving a CASA volunteer. The general comment provided by the respondents was that CASA volunteers advocate and monitor cases by visiting the families, recommending services, and pushing the parents to succeed. We found that 49 percent of the respondents to the OIG survey stated that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were as likely to be reunited with their family for the following reasons: \u2022 Reunification is in the hands of the parents and their willingness to change and comply with services. \u2022 Reunification is in the best interest of the family and CASA pushes the family to succeed. Finally, 16 percent of the respondents stated that children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were less likely to be reunited with their family. The general comment provided by the respondents was that cases involving a CASA volunteer are the most severe and difficult because they generally involve the most serious cases of maltreatment. Summary and Conclusion We found that OJP had established outcome measures for its CASA grant programs. However, the outcome measures established by OJP do not address the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. Additionally, none of the outcome measures established by OJP address the outcome measures mandated by Congress for this audit. - 33 - Further, with the exception of the length of time a child spends in foster care, HHS does not require state and local CPS agencies to report data that specifically addresses the outcome measures mandated for this audit. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide data that specifically addresses the outcome measures required for this audit. Nonetheless, based on the available studies, data, and the results of the OIG survey, we found that in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved: \u2022 the children spent more time in foster care as result of the fact that the children were generally already in foster care before a CASA volunteer was assigned; \u2022 the children and their parents were ordered by the courts to participate in more services and received more services; \u2022 the case was more likely to be \u201cpermanently closed,\u201d i.e., the children were less likely to reenter the CWS; and \u2022 the children were more likely to be adopted and less likely to be reunified with their parents. The Caliber Study found that the majority of cases involving a CASA volunteer are typically the most serious cases of maltreatment. This was supported by the 2005 Organizational Research Services Study which concluded there is a general consensus (over 80 percent of respondents) that judges tend to assign the most difficult cases to CASA volunteers. Therefore, although the outcomes for cases involving a CASA volunteer appear to be less favorable in some instances than cases not involving a CASA volunteer, this may be a result of the fact that cases involving a CASA volunteer are typically the most serious cases of maltreatment. As a result, children in these types of cases are more likely to: (1) be placed in foster care, (2) require more services, and (3) be adopted rather than reunified with their parents. However, we also found that based on the limited information available, children in cases involving a CASA volunteer were less likely to reenter the CWS after permanent placement was achieved. - 34 - Recommendation We recommend that OJP: 2. Develop outcome-based performance measures for the CASA grant programs to determine the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the needs of children in the CWS. As appropriate, these outcome measures should correspond with the data required by HHS for state and local CPS agencies, so that OJP has a basis for comparing the effectiveness of its CASA grant programs. - 35 - STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS In planning and performing our audit of the NCASAA Program, we considered NCASAA\u2019s internal controls for the purpose of determining our auditing procedures. The evaluation was not made for the purpose of providing assurance on the internal control structure as a whole. However, we noted certain matters that we consider reportable conditions under generally accepted government auditing standards.24 Finding I \u2022 From 1999 through 2006, NCASAA erroneously allocated $1.23 million of its OJP grant funds to fundraising activities. However, we determined the $1.23 million was the result of an accounting error. \u2022 In 1998 and 1999 NCASAA failed to input a program accounting code identifying the program activity for expenses totaling about $1.5 million. Because we are not expressing an opinion on the overall internal control structure of NCASAA, this statement is intended solely for the information and use of OJP and NCASAA in administering federal grants. 24 Reportable conditions involve matters coming to our attention relating to significant deficiencies in the design or operation of the internal control structure that, in our judgment, could adversely affect the ability of NCASAA administer its grants. - 36 - STATEMENT ON COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS As required by the Government Auditing Standards, we tested NCASAA\u2019s records and documentation for the period of January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006, to obtain reasonable assurance that it complied with laws and regulations that, if not complied with, in our judgment could have a material effect on the administration of federal grant funds. Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the allowability and allocability of federal grant expenditures, including subgrantee expenditures, is the responsibility of NCASAA management. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about compliance with laws and regulations. At the time of our audit, the federal regulations governing the requirements for federal grants could be found in: \u2022 28 C.F.R. Part 70 (updated 2006), Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements (including subawards) with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-profit Organizations \u2022 OMB Circular A-110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations \u2022 OMB Circular A-122, Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations \u2022 OMB Circular A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal Control Except for the issues discussed in the Findings and Recommendations section of this report, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that NCASAA management was not in compliance with the federal regulations governing the requirements for federal grants listed above. - 37 - APPENDIX I OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY We conducted an audit of NCASAA and the member CASA programs to determine: (1) the types of activities NCASAA has funded since 1993, and (2) the outcomes in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved, including: \u2022 the length of time a child spends in foster care; \u2022 the extent to which there is an increased provision of services; \u2022 the percentage of cases permanently closed; and \u2022 achievement of the permanent plan for reunification or adoption. We conducted our audit in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. We included such tests as were necessary to accomplish the audit objectives. The audit generally covered, but was not limited to, the period of January 1, 1993, through June 30, 2006. Audit work was conducted at NCASAA and state, local, and tribal CASA program offices. To determine the types of activities funded by NCASAA since 1993, we requested that NCASAA provide accounting data from January 1, 1993, through June 30, 2006, for all expenditures from both federal and private funding sources. We found that NCASAA did not retain any accounting records or supporting documentation for expenditures occurring prior to 1995. Additionally, although NCASAA retained some of the accounting records and supporting documentation for 1995 through 1997, the information was incomplete. According to federal regulations (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 70, updated 2006) grantees are only required to retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to Department of Justice grants for a period of 3 years from the date of submission of the final financial report. Therefore, NCASAA was not required to retain the accounting records and supporting documentation for its expenditures occurring prior to 1998, and we do not take exception to this practice. As a result, our analysis was limited to the period of January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006. To determine the types of activities funded by NCASAA from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006, we sorted the expenditures reported in NCASAA\u2019s general ledgers by program code. Additionally, we - 38 - requested summary accounting information for the subgrantee expenditures for the same time period, which we also sorted by type of expense. To verify NCASAA expenses for allowability and allocability, we judgmentally selected 25 cost accounts totaling over $1.6 million. Additionally, we randomly selected 15 transactions totaling over $500,000. We tested the supporting documentation for all expenditures included in our sample to determine if the costs were allowable, allocable, and properly supported. To determine the outcomes in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved, we found that with the exception of the length of time a child spends in foster care, HHS does not require state and local CPS agencies to report data that specifically addresses the outcome measures mandated by Congress for this audit. NCASAA also does not request that its CASA program members provide data that specifically addresses the outcome measures required for this audit. As a result, although we obtained data for the state and local CASA programs that we used to address the audit objectives, we were not always able to obtain comparison data for cases that did not involve a CASA volunteer. Further, OJP had not established outcome measures for any of its grant programs that provide funding to CASA programs. Additionally, at any point in time, only a small percentage of the participating state, local, and tribal CASA programs have open subgrants of OJP grant funding awarded by NCASAA. For those CASA programs that do not have subgrants NCASAA can request, but not require, that they provide outcome data. Nonetheless, for its 2005 Annual Program Survey, NCASAA received data on children from 90 percent of its CASA program members. Because of the lack of data on the objectives mandated for this audit, to determine the outcomes in cases where CASA volunteers are involved as compared to cases where CASA volunteers are not involved, we relied on the following: \u2022 prior studies of the NCASAA program; \u2022 data from the state and local CASA program case-tracking databases (CASA Data Request), which we compared to national data maintained by HHS; \u2022 data from an OIG survey distributed to all state, local, and tribal CASA program offices; and - 39 - \u2022 the most recent AFCARS data available at the time our analysis was conducted on all children in the state and local CPS for comparison purposes.25 We identified two studies of the CASA program that in our judgment provided the most comprehensive and current information related to this objective. \u2022 Youngclarke, Davin M. and Kathleen Ramos and Lorraine Granger-Merkle. \\\"A Systematic Review of the Impact of Court-Appointed Special Advocates,\\\" Journal of the Center for Families, Children and the Courts, Vol. 5, 2004, pp. 109-126 (Youngclarke Review). The Youngclarke Review summarized the findings of 20 prior studies that assessed the impact of CASA programs. In conducting the review, almost 70 prior studies of CASA programs were analyzed, but only 20 met the criteria for inclusion in the results of the Youngclarke Review. The review compares the combined average outcome measures reported in the prior studies for cases involving a CASA volunteer to those for which a CASA volunteer was not appointed. \u2022 Caliber Associates, Evaluation of CASA Representation, 2004, (Caliber Study).26 The Caliber Study combines data from NCASAA\u2019s management information systems and data collected through the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a federally sponsored national survey of children and their families. The study compares outcome measures for cases involving a CASA volunteer to those for which a CASA volunteer was not appointed. For the CASA Data Request, NCASAA distributed our request for data from the case management systems to 731 state, local, and tribal CASA programs. We received data from 192 respondents representing 339 programs. Additionally, we distributed a nationwide survey to state, local, and tribal CASA programs offices requesting information on the four outcome measures, as well as additional information on the: (1) basis for the responses related to the four outcome measures in our survey, 25 It should be noted that HHS does not collect separate data on CASA cases, rather the AFCARS data includes all CASA and non-CASA cases related to children in the state and local CPS. 26 It should be noted that the Caliber Study was funded in part by NCASAA. Funding was also provided by the Packard Foundation. - 40 - (2) effectiveness of NCASAA, and (3) data reported in the Caliber Study. Out of the 945 CASA programs to which the OIG survey was sent, we received 491 responses. The consolidated results of the OIG survey are detailed in Appendix II. - 41 - OIG SURVEY CONSOLIDATED RESPONSES The following guidance was provided to the survey respondents at the beginning of the survey: APPENDIX II We ask that you answer each question to the best of your knowledge as it pertains to your program office.

Based on the comments provided by respondents who said \u201cno,\u201d we believe that question 29 may have been misinterpreted. The question was whether children with a CASA volunteer are more likely to be placed in foster care. The respondents who said \u201cno\u201d commented that the children were already in foster care. 30. The evaluation of the CASA Representation report indicated that children who had a CASA/GAL volunteer were more likely to be placed in foster care longer than children without a CASA/GAL volunteer.

Of the 298 respondents (66 percent) who said \u201cno,\u201d 268 provided comments that included the following: - 62 - \u2022 69 of the 268 respondents stated that CASA volunteers focus on achieving permanency faster so children do not stay in foster care too long. 31. The evaluation of the CASA Representation report indicated that children and parents with a CASA/GAL volunteer were provided with more services on average than children without CASA/GAL volunteer. In your opinion, are more services ordered: A. for children with a CASA/GAL volunteer?

    "comment": "March 10, 2008 Kathleen McHugh Director, Division of Policy, Children\u2019s Bureau Administration for Children and Families U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Attention: 45 CFR Part 1355 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20024 Re: 45 CFR Part 1355 Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System; Proposed Rule To Whom it May Concern: First Focus respectfully submits this comment letter regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) with Comment Period on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), published in the Federal Register on January 11, 2008 (73 FR 2082) for the Administration for Children and Family Services (ACF) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). First Focus is a bipartisan advocacy organization committed to making children and their families a priority in federal policy and budget decisions. Our organization is dedicated to the long-term goal of substantially reducing the number of children entering foster care, and working to ensure that our existing system of care protects children and adequately meets the needs of families in the child welfare system. We share ACF\u2019s commitment to improving the AFCARS, and commend its efforts to improve data accuracy and develop a comprehensive and reliable longitudinal child welfare data system. Developing the capacity to collect and utilize longitudinal data and track children as they move through the system is invaluable and will serve to guide program management and the development of effective public policy. The data compiled and available through AFCARS provide critical information to federal, state and local governments, as well as to advocates, researchers and other stakeholders. The AFCARS is an invaluable resource, and is utilized in developing the Annual Child Welfare Report to Congress, Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSR), supporting policy, outcome measurement, and determining funding allocations for the Chafee Independent Living and Adoption Incentive Programs. We would like to share several suggestions for revising the proposed rule and ultimately improving our understanding of children\u2019s experiences and functioning in foster care and adoptive homes. Our comments fall into five general categories: (1) the importance of convening a working group to assist in Page 2 of 3 the development of the AFCARS data structure; (2) delineating a reasonable data reporting window for states; (3) enhancing the AFCARS dataset by adding several additional items; (4) providing appropriate compliance standards; and (5) offering incentives for compliance and additional technical assistance to states, and creating a penalty structure that differentiates magnitude of error in reporting. Working Group. As noted in this NPRM, ACF intends to significantly restructure the AFCARS data file in order to support longitudinal data analysis and appropriately capture comprehensive information on a child\u2019s experiences in foster care and adoptive homes. We applaud this ambitious undertaking, and to ensure successful implementation, recommend that ACF convene a working group, comprised of child welfare research and data experts, to assist in the development of the AFCARS data structure and to provide guidance in crafting a robust longitudinal data system. Moreover, we would like to highlight the following additional areas of concern regarding provisions of this NPRM: \u00a71355.42 Data Reporting Requirements. The NPRM proposes that the state agency submit data files within 15 days of the end of the reporting period, a significant reduction in time from the current 45-day reporting window. We are concerned that the shortened data submission timeframe will make it difficult for states to meet the 100 percent accuracy benchmarks set forth in the proposed regulation. As the American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) points out, \u201cstate- and county- administered systems will have difficulty assessing the quality of data and submitting it within 15 days, especially as data may be entered into a state\u2019s system within 15 days of occurrence, making the most current data eligible for data entry available on the very day of transmission.\u201d Moreover, new data requirements, including an expansion of the reporting population proposed in the regulation, will mean that data files will grow considerably in size and complexity, and states would require perhaps even more time to accurately process, analyze and clean the data before submission. We are also concerned about the time commitment necessary for collecting data from additional systems, including juvenile justice and mental health agencies. States will need to allow time for other systems to submit their records, and will need to ensure the accuracy of the data. According to the NPRM, ACF believes that receiving the data a month earlier will better meet state and Federal needs, and allow for improved analysis of the data for use in CFSR data profiles and program improvement plans. Ultimately, ensuring the integrity of AFCARS data is paramount and should be prioritized above timeliness. We recommend that the final rule be revised to allow at least the current 45-day window to submit data files, and encourages ACF to reconsider the timeline for reporting to recognize the importance of data quality and accuracy, and facilitate states\u2019 efforts to provide reliable and meaningful data. \u00a71355.43 Out-of-Home Care Date File Elements. The proposed NPRM includes a number of additional data and research elements for states in the out-of-home care data file. We have outlined below recommendations for additional items that ACF should include as AFCARS elements. I. \u00a71355.43 (b) (8). Information about special education would be more accurately determined by asking whether the child has a current Individualized Education Plan (IEP). II. School Enrollment. It would be valuable to collect information on whether a child is currently enrolled in school. Page 3 of 3 III. School Stability. We believe it would be useful to collect information on a child\u2019s school placement changes (frequency), in order to determine school stability and examine its relative impact on child outcomes. IV. Early Intervention Service Utilization. It would be informative to collect information on the utilization of early intervention services for infants to children age 3. V. Removal Information: Inadequate Housing. In order to better understand the role of inadequate housing as a factor in a child\u2019s placement into foster care, we recommend establishing a separate option for homelessness, outside the general assessment of housing as \u201csubstandard, overcrowded, unsafe or otherwise inadequate.\u201d It is critical to understand how many children enter foster care because one or both parents lack housing. VI. Post-placement Outcomes. We would like to suggest that post-placement outcomes, including post-foster care living arrangement, education placement and employment status be included in the AFCARS. \u00a71355.45 Compliance. ACF proposes that the demographic data collected and submitted by states be 100 percent accurate. This is an unrealistic requirement, and one even hospitals \u2013 which typically have a 99% accuracy rate - do not follow. In addition, from a scientific perspective, you do not need 100% accuracy to draw valid conclusions. In practice, 99% is a very high standard. We fear that having such an unrealistic requirement may motivate workers to enter inaccurate data simply to ensure that all fields are filled and that there are no missing data. \u00a71355.46 Penalties. The proposed rule sets forth specific fiscal penalties for a state agency\u2019s lack of compliance with AFCARS standards, yet no incentives are provided. Strict penalties are set to go into effect at the time of the final regulation, allowing for no flexibility for states as they transform their current AFCARS systems. We urge ACF to reconsider the proposed penalty structure, and ensure that penalties not be enacted for a reasonable period of time, to allow states to effectively overhaul their data systems. In addition, the proposed penalty structure does not differentiate the magnitude of error. Instead, it poses the same penalty on a state that submits a data file with one error as for a state with several errors. We believe penalties should be commensurate with the degree of error to allow for incremental improvements. In addition, states would greatly benefit from ongoing support and technical assistance from ACF as they develop an implementation process and plan. AFCARS is an important resource for the child welfare community and provides crucial information to guide program management and policy development. We thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed regulation. If you have any additional questions, please contact Shadi Houshyar, VP for child welfare policy, at (202) 657-0678. Sincerely, Bruce Lesley President",

    "comment": "Kathleen McHugh Director, Division of Policy, Children\u2019s Bureau, ACYF, ACF 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 20024 Submitted via e-mail to: CBComments@acf.hhs.gov RE: Request for Public Comment on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 8 / Friday, January 11, 2008 Dear Ms. McHugh, Casey Family Programs appreciates the opportunity to submit comments and recommendations regarding the Children\u2019s Bureau\u2019s proposed rules to amend the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) regulations at 45 CFR 1355.40 and the appendices to part 1355. Casey Family Programs (CFP) is the nation\u2019s largest operating foundation focused solely on providing, improving, and ultimately preventing, the need for foster care. CFP has served children and families for more than 40 years. We continually work to improve care and help spread innovative practices throughout the child welfare system. Through our strategic consulting services we provide the knowledge and expertise of our highly qualified, experienced staff free of charge to child welfare systems in cities, counties, and states across the country. We currently provide direct services in 7 states, serving 15,000 children and families through various programs and activities. CFP also provides Indian tribes, states and counties with Indian child welfare assistance. Our ultimate goal is to share our knowledge of what works best, to help child welfare systems provide the best service possible, so that more children and families stay together and thrive. In addition to our direct service and strategic consulting work in the field, we work to educate federal, state, and local public policy leaders about issues that affect vulnerable children and families across the country. Our goal is to provide policymakers with quality nonpartisan research and data that inform cost effective policy solutions. We believe that through proven, innovative practice we can continue to improve outcomes for children and families and enhance child welfare measurement and accountability. AFCARS, created by federal mandate nearly twenty years ago, currently provides a national snapshot of children in foster care and adoption. The data collection tool was an important first step towards standardizing the information collected about children in care and helped the Children\u2019s Bureau, Congress, states, child welfare agencies and advocates begin using data to inform policies and programs designed to best meet the needs of children in foster care and adoption. It should also be noted that currently tribal child welfare data is included in AFCARS only in cases where tribal/state IV-E agreements are in place. Data collected from AFCARS is used for various purposes, including the development of national standards by which states are evaluated, determination of federal program allotments, and the creation of profiles for federal reviews. We applaud your efforts to improve AFCARS so that it can be a more effective 1 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM tool for all stakeholders to ensure that a child\u2019s safety, permanency, and well-being needs are met. We have focused our comments on 3 primary areas: 1. The creation of a longitudinal data system and the collection of more comprehensive data about a child\u2019s and family\u2019s experience in child welfare; 2. The impact on states to achieve compliance and resulting penalties; and 3. The opportunities to strengthen proposed language through clarification. Section 1: Longitudinal Data and the Collection of More Comprehensive Data We support your proposal to restructure the current AFCARS system to support the collection of longitudinal data. Casey Family Programs believes that reliable, comprehensive, real-time data drives effective policies and programs. States, administrators, advocates, and communities need a data system that can reflect a comprehensive picture of a child\u2019s experience, including the reasons a child entered care, where a child is placed while in care, the child\u2019s needs while in care, and the circumstances that supported the child\u2019s eventual exit from care. Having such a data system will help in the pursuit of major goals in child welfare: maintaining children safely at home whenever possible, finding children permanent homes in a timely way, and ensuring that children\u2019s well-being needs are met while in foster care. The current AFCARS system collects only a small cross section of information about the child and family and does so for a single reporting period. As a result, the data provides an incomplete picture of a child\u2019s experience in foster care, particularly with regard to progress towards their placement goal. Some states, including California and North Carolina, have created their own data reporting systems that produce more complex and comprehensive analysis of the children and families they are serving, using a data structure created by child welfare data experts including the Center for Social Services Research (CSSR) at the University of California, Berkeley; the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and the State Data Center for Foster Care and Adoption at Chapin Hall. This type of data collection and analyses should be available to all states and federal policymakers in order to better understand the factors that could help lead to a safe reduction in the number of children in out-of-home care in this country. Section 1355.42(b)(2) requires states to report both current and historical information for nearly all data elements. This new reporting requirement will help states, agencies, policymakers, and advocates develop a more comprehensive understanding of the children and families being served by child welfare systems. We appreciate the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families\u2019 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cDepartment\u201d) modifications throughout the proposed rules requiring the collection of current and historical information on data elements related to the child\u2019s removal from care, living arrangement and provider information, permanency plan and information about ongoing circumstances, as well as information related to the child\u2019s exit from care. We also support related section 1355.43(a)(4), which requires unique identifiers for the child. We encourage you to work with child welfare data experts, including those identified above, to develop an AFCARS data structure that accurately collects this information so that the data collected is useful to policymakers at 2 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM both the federal and state level as well as child welfare agencies serving vulnerable children and their families. In addition, we strongly support your proposal to collect additional information about each child in foster care, including information about his/her family structure, the child and his/her families\u2019 needs. Specifically, CFP supports the NPRM\u2019s proposal to clarify or, for the first time, collect information about: Siblings. Many children in care report that the trauma of separation from their families and communities is particularly acute when they are separated from their siblings. These feelings are often exacerbated when older children in care assume a parental role in the home. Most experts support the placement of siblings together whenever it safe to do so. They understand that this can have a positive impact on the child\u2019s well-being. In order for state and federal program administrators and policymakers to understand the scope of this issue, it is important that AFCARS collect information about sibling living arrangements at the time of removal and their ability to be placed together in out-of-home care. We therefore support the new requirement in section 1355.43(b) to report the number of siblings the child was living with at the time of removal. We also support section 1355.43(e)(8) of the proposed rules which requires states to report how many siblings were placed together. The creation of a unique identifier for the family in section 1355.43(a)(5) of the NPRM also presents an opportunity for the child welfare system to track family structure, including placement and care of siblings. However, the changing dynamics of families over time and the complex family structures experienced by many children served by child welfare agencies makes the collection of such information very challenging. We recommend that you work with child welfare data experts in developing this section of the final AFCARS rules. Kinship Care. CFP appreciates the Department\u2019s increased attention to children placed with relative caregivers. Our experience with children and families served by child welfare agencies leads us to believe that relative caregivers (whether non-fictive or fictive) play an important role in providing care for children while in foster care, as well as providing permanent families for children exiting foster care, either through adoption or legal guardianship. Accurate information about children placed in care and their caregivers can help policymakers and child welfare agencies serve these children more effectively. Section 1355.43(e)(3) requires the state to indicate whether a child is living in a licensed home, and includes relative foster homes (either licensed or unlicensed) as a category. The NPRM makes clear that fictive kin are not included in the definition of relative caregiver. Fictive kin placements are clearly different from stranger foster homes, and are included in the definition of relative foster homes in some states. Other states create a distinct category for fictive kin. In order to maintain consistency, we seek further clarification from the Department about collecting information about children placed with fictive kin. 3 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM CFP also supports the Department\u2019s proposal to collect information about children placed in subsidized guardianships. However, we seek clarification about a subset of children involved in legal guardianships. Based on the definition of out-of-home care in section 1355.40(c), requiring that a child be \u201caway from his or her\u2026legal guardian for 24 hours or more\u2026\u201d it is clear that children in such living arrangements are not in the out-of-home care reporting population. Some states retain placement and care with the state agency but also designate foster families or kinship providers as the legal guardians. However, these care and living arrangements are different from legal guardianships where the state does not retain care and custody. Further clarification is needed in categorizing these arrangements. Race. Casey Family Programs is a member of the Casey-CSSP Alliance for Racial Equity in Child Welfare (Alliance). The Alliance is a partnership of several leading foundations, agencies, and associations that focus on improving our nation\u2019s child welfare systems. It was established to develop and implement a national, multiyear campaign to address racial disparities and reduce the disproportionate representation of children of color in the nation\u2019s child welfare system. CFP, as part of the Alliance, is very supportive of the proposal to collect information about race and ethnicity through self-identification. A growing number of children involved with child welfare agencies are identified as \u201cmultiracial\u201d or recorded as \u201crace unknown.\u201d Self identification improves our ability to accurately capture race and ethnic information and, as a consequence, improves the analyses of racial disparities and disproportionality. However, there are also specific concerns that should be addressed in order to make the data collection process, and the resulting information, useful in understanding racial disparities. First, in section1355.43(b)(3) the categories of race currently proposed are American Indian/Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; or White. These categories do not provide enough options, they are inconsistent with the elements currently collected by many states, and they do not provide an option that many Latino families would self-identify. Secondly, the new time frame for submission of data presents significant challenges related to the collection of race and ethnicity elements. The current regulations allow states to submit data within 45 days of the end of the reporting period. \u00a71355.42(a) proposes to shorten that deadline to 15 days. CFP questions the ability of the agencies to meet with families, allow the families to self-identify race and ethnicity, and transmit that information from the field to the central data collection system, and provide a timely submission of this data to the AFCARS system, within a 15 day timeframe. This shortened timeframe may result in greater numbers of \u201crace unknown\u201d cases and exacerbate rather than resolve the problem of data collection related to analyzing and addressing racial disparities. We recommend that you work with states to include a comprehensive list of race/ethnic categories and that the new timeframe be revisited to ensure the collection of accurate data. 4 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM Education. For children in out-of-home care, education success is a potential positive counterweight to the trauma associated with the maltreatment that brought them to the attention of child welfare agencies and the additional trauma associated with their entry into foster care. A child\u2019s education experience is closely tied to their child welfare system experience. If a child is struggling or unsuccessful in school it can have a tremendous impact on his or her permanency goals and finalization of a stable living arrangement. Unfortunately, the educational outcomes for children in out-of-home care are dismal. Data on education outcomes is limited, particularly national data. However, the existing data makes clear that serious issues must be addressed to ensure the education success of children in out-of-home care. Child welfare agencies working with children and families need to know basic information about a child\u2019s education performance and placement to appropriately meet the needs of the child and achieve permanency and well-being. At the same time, it is important to make clear that inclusion of education data elements is not intended to imply sole accountability on the part of child welfare agencies around the outcomes collected. However, without tracking education outcomes such as special education enrollment and grade retention, we cannot begin to identify actions needed to address these outcomes. As a member of the National Working Group on Foster Care and Education, CFP would like to express our general support for the three education data elements recommended in the NPRM. In addition, we suggest adding elements to capture information about school changes related to placement changes and timely enrollment. Specifically, CFP recommends the addition of two companion questions to the living arrangement inquiry: (1) whether a school change occurred due to the change in living arrangement; and (2) whether that school change resulted in a delay in re-enrollment in a new school. Current AFCARS data already reveals that children in out-of-home care have an average of one to two changes in their living arrangement per year. High rates of school mobility often result in students falling behind academically and increase the likelihood that they will not graduate. Data through AFCARS that could identify exactly how many school moves children in out-of-home care are experiencing would be vital information to address the critical education needs of this population. In addition, detail about delays in re-enrollment when school moves occur would also provide important information about a known problem for children in out-of-home care. We also suggest more detail for the special education inquiry. Numerous studies indicate anywhere from 23% to 47% of children and youth in out-of-home care receive special education services at some point in their schooling (compared to the national average of 12% of school age children). Inclusion of a data element to identify how many children are receiving special education services would give, for the first time, concrete statewide and national data on the numbers of special education students in out-of-home care. This data could be used to track 5 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM increases and decreases in special education identification and engage state and federal agencies that focus on special education to address the unique needs of children in out-of-home care. There are three areas tied to special education that could be added to expand on the information collected: Inclusion of Early Intervention Services. A 2005 national study of 2,813 young children in out-of-home care found that about 40% of toddlers and 50% of preschoolers have high developmental and behavioral needs; however, only 23% of the children overall are receiving services for these issues. The current element would not capture children age birth to three who are eligible for special education through early intervention services. It is not well understood that 0-3 services are special education services, so data could be underreported if there is not a strong cue that it includes younger than school age children, even if intent changes. Eligibility. The currently proposed response options do not clarify if the lack of special education is due to ineligibility or because special education has never been pursued. Detailed Information about the Child\u2019s Education Disability. Special education has unique categories of disability that do not always match clinical definitions of disabilities or disorders. While the list of conditions currently proposed provides information from a clinical or medical perspective, they are inadequate to capture education disabilities. We recommend including an additional element that allows users to choose from the IDEA categories of impairment used to find the child eligible to receive special education services. Reporting Population. Section 1355.41 redefines the reporting population by creating a new category of \u201cChildren in Out-Of-Home Care.\u201d We support the clarification that all children \u2013 regardless of placement setting \u2013 are included in the out-of-home care data collection. In order to produce consistent data across states and in order to fully understand the needs of children placed in foster care, it is critical that all states report on children, regardless of their placement type. In fact, it may be particularly important to understand those children who are placed in non-traditional settings, as they may face the greatest obstacles to achieving permanency and meeting a range of well-being outcomes. As a result, CFP agrees that states should include children in out-of-home care who are placed in detention facilities, psychiatric facilities, or jails as long as they are in the care and custody of the state\u2019s IV-B/IV-E agency. We also support the related requirement in Section 1355.43 (g)(5), which requires the state to provide additional detail for the exit option \u201ctransfer to another agency\u201d by specifying the type of agency to which a child\u2019s placement and care was transferred. CFP supports the list of options to be included: tribe or tribal agency, juvenile justice agency, mental health agency, another state agency, or a private agency. This will enhance the ability to adequately track a child\u2019s journey through the child welfare system. 6 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM Collection of information about the child and family\u2019s circumstances at the time of removal. CFP recognizes that the best way to safely reduce the number of children in out-of-home care is through an increased emphasis on prevention. In order to promote appropriate prevention programs, states must better understand the reasons children are removed from their homes. We are therefore pleased to see that the data elements in section 1355.43(d) have been expanded and modified to provide a more comprehensive picture of the circumstances surrounding the child\u2019s removal from their home. In particular, we support the modifications made that: expands the definition of incarcerated parents to include legal guardians in addition to parent or caretaker and the inclusion of incarceration in prison, not just jail; expands the list of circumstances that led to the child\u2019s removal to include allegations or substantiated cases of medical neglect, failure to supervise (as distinct from neglect), and domestic violence in addition to the current categories of physical abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse; adds a data element to identify when a child enters care in order to access mental health or other medical services; modifies data elements related to parental alcohol and drug abuse to include not only long-term abuse, but any circumstance when the parent was abusing substances; and clarifies that states must report all circumstances presented by the family at the time of removal, not merely those that the caseworker feels are the primary reasons for removal. Section 2: The Impact of the Proposed Restructuring of AFCARS on States; Compliance; and Related Penalties Although CFP supports many of the new data elements included in the proposed regulations, we realize that states need adequate time, support, and resources to reach compliance. States may need to make changes to their data collection systems, which could require state legislation and/or funding to implement. In addition, there are additional factors that require time, including staff training. We recommend that HHS take such factors into consideration when instituting compliance dates. This is of particular concern to CFP because the calculations used to determine the cost to the states to create an average time for compliance did not include all relevant factors including the time for systems change, training of staff, time required to gather the data in order to enter it into the computer, and supervisory review. The time required for compliance will vary by state. States need time to do a full analysis of what it will take for them to reach compliance. In addition, there are elements where data may not be available or do not necessarily fit neatly into a predetermined set of choices. These responses should not be scored as a reporting error. For example, section 1355.43(b)(12) of the proposed 7 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM regulations require that young adults in the system report whether or not they are a parent. Not all young men in the system know with certainty whether they are a parent. The Department could add an option to respond as unknown or not yet determined. We recognize that tension between the complete reporting of available information about the child and family and flexibility in reporting dynamic and fluid information exists. We strongly encourage you to identify those areas where data may not be available with the understanding that these situations should be rare and require a justification in writing by the state. Section 1355.46 describes how ACF will assess and take penalties for a state\u2019s failure to comply with AFCAR requirements. The NPRM notes that the Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 requires the Department take specific penalties. The law does not, however, proscribe how those penalties should be used, nor does it prohibit combining such penalties with incentives for compliance. The Food Stamp Program illustrates an effective use of penalties and incentives to increase compliance while providing states the support they need to improve performance. 1 The Food Stamp Act, similar to the Adoption Promotion Act of 2003, grants the department administering the program (USDA for the Food Stamp Program and DHHS for the Foster Care and Adoption Program) broad flexibility on how much of the sanctions it will actually collect. Since the early 1990s, the USDA has offered states the alternative between paying the entire sanction amount and entering into agreements under which some of their potential liabilities are waived and some must be reinvested. States must expend the reinvested funds on error reduction activities the USDA approves, such as additional administrative staff or staff training. In addition to financial sanctions for high error rates, the Food Stamp Program provides states incentives for high performance. States may receive enhanced administrative funding if their combined error rate is below the established baseline. We recommend that HHS employ the combination of penalties that are reinvested and incentives for high performance, similar to those employed by the USDA in the Food Stamp Program. Section 3: Collecting Consistent Data (within and across States) and Other Areas Needing Clarification or Amendments Youth in care after age 18. Section 1355.41 of the NPRM, requires states report data on youth who continue to remain in care past their 18th birthday and remain eligible for IV-E support. Many youth who are no longer eligible for IV-E funding remain in care not only to age 19, but up to age 21 in some states with state funding. These youth remain in the care and custody of the state agency. We recommend that states report these youth in the total out- of-home care population in order to more accurately reflect the caseloads within states and staff workload. 1 Rosenbaum, D. (2000). Improving Access to Food Stamps: New Reporting Options Can Reduce Administrative Burdens and Error Rates. Washington, DC. 8 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM Date of the permanency plan. Section 1355.43 (f)(2) requires states to report the date of the permanency plan. There are many possible interpretations of this data element, including the date when the worker creates the plan, the date the supervisor approves the plan, or the date when the plan is approved by a court. Further clarification is needed from ACF regarding this element. In addition, we appreciate the Department\u2019s efforts to restructure data collected about older youth in care to reflect the mandates of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, by removing long term foster care as a permanency option and replacing it with Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA). However, we were troubled to see that you propose to add \u201cindependent living\u201d as a permanency option despite \u201cconcerns about State practice in this area.\u201d We believe that inclusion of this option this will create the mistaken impression that it is a viable permanency option. CFP believes that all children need, and that states should pursue on their behalf, permanent families. Independent living services should be available to all children who the state determines are likely to remain in care, even if they are placed in another planned permanent living arrangement. We strongly urge you remove this category as a permanency plan option. Exits to Adoption. Section 1355.43 (h)(2) of the proposed regulations require states to report whether the adoptive parent was the child\u2019s foster parent. Section 1355.43(e)(3) requires that the state indicate whether a child is living in a licensed home, and includes relative foster homes (either licensed or unlicensed) as a category. We recommend that the proposed rules clarify whether states will capture whether the foster parents adopting were licensed or unlicensed. Adoption Assistance Payments. Section 1355.44 (c)(3-4) of the proposed regulations require states to report whether IV-E funds were used to pay for nonrecurring adoption expenses. Many states provide similar funds for families adopting children who are not IV-E eligible with state dollars or other non IV-E federal funds. We seek clarification whether ACF intends to collect data about state paid nonrecurring adoption expenses. Funding Sources. Section 1355.43(e)(20) requires states report the sources of federal assistance in living arrangements for each child. Although the state agency and caseworker can be expected to know whether the child is IV-E eligible, it may not be realistic to expect the state agency to have the capacity to report other sources of federal assistance per child. Many states do not allocate flexible federal assistance per child. We seek clarification on this data element. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond to the NPRM to amend the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System. We want to reiterate our strong support for the proposal to create, for the first time, a longitudinal database. We anticipate that this reform will provide the type of data needed for federal and state 9 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM policymakers, child serving agencies, and advocates to better assist children who are in foster care move out of foster care in a safe and timely way, and help ensure that children remain safely in permanent families. 10 Casey Family Programs Comments: AFCARS NPRM",

    "comment": "DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES KEVIN W. CONCANNON, DIRECTOR CHESTER J. CULVER, GOVERNOR PATTY JUDGE, LT. GOVERNOR March 11, 2008 Kathleen McHugh Administration for Children and Families U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Attention: 45 CFR Part 1355 1250 Maryland Avenue SW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20024 Re: 45 CFR Part 1355 Adoption Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System: Proposed Rule To Whom It May Concern: The Iowa Department of Human Services, Division of Child and Family Services, respectfully submits this comment letter regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule Making with Comment Period on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, published in the Federal Register on January 11, 2008 (73 FR 2082) for the Administration for Children and Family Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Iowa would like to recognize and praise ACF\u2019s intention to incorporate more longitudinal data in the AFCARS data so that it can be incorporated into the CFSR performance measures. 1355.40 Scope of the adoption and foster care analysis and reporting system and 1355.41 Reporting Population. In part C you propose a new definition of \u201cout of home care\u201d that is a significant change from the definition of foster care at 1355.20. This new category of children in \u201cout of home care\u201d would expand the population of children to be reported on beyond the realm of children in foster care and would require states to begin reporting information on children that have never been considered to be subject to title IV-E and IV-B regulation and for whom the IV-B protections are not applicable. For example, children who are placed in detention for criminal activities with no intention of them ever entering a foster care placement due to the nature of the offense, or children who are placed in psychiatric medical facilities with no court involvement and no intention of them ever entering a foster care placement. We feel that the additional reporting requirements represent an unwarranted intrusion into these families lives and because these children are served by different agencies or with different objectives, gathering timely and accurate data will be difficult and in many cases there will be gaps in the required data as it will not be relevant to the circumstances or needs of the child. Further, to the extent that these services are paid for with public funds (e.g. Medicaid, Mental Health, Substance Abuse) those agencies will be reporting data on these children creating a duplication of effort. It is also difficult to determine what impact the expanded population will have on the 1305 E WALNUT STREET \u2013 DES MOINES, IA 50319-0114 calculation of outcomes for the Child and Family Services Review. Will the children who are not traditionally considered part of the child welfare population be included in the calculation of outcome measures? If not how will they be separated? The NPRM also proposes changing the definition of when to stop reporting a child in AFCARS. In this proposal, children who go home on trial basis would no longer be reported to AFCARS. The theory is that these children, while possibly still under supervision of the agency, are no longer fully in the care of the state agency. This change in definition will have a significant effect on the national standards related to length of stay in foster care as well as re-entry rates. It is also a departure from how a child\u2019s foster care episode is counted for IV-E eligibility. We feel that trial home visits should continue to be reported. 1355.42 Data Reporting Requirements You propose to continue the schedule of reporting data once every 6 months and we would support this decision. In addition you have proposed to shorten the time that states have to extract and review this data prior to submission from 45 to 15 days. This change would have a negative impact on the quality of the data being submitted for a number of reasons. First, the 15 day limit is the same as the limit for the entry of certain data elements like removal date and exit date which means that states will have to extract data from their systems before these required entries have been made. This will further exacerbate the problem of cross-file consistency errors. Secondly, the 15 day window for submission does not provide sufficient time for the state to conduct quality reviews of the data and to initiate corrective actions before submittal of the file. The 15 day window also does not allow time for data from other agencies to be integrated into the process and checked for quality so that the state can meet the requirements of reporting on the expanded population of children in \u201cout of home care\u201d. The increase in the amount of data to be collected will increase the amount of work necessary to prepare the extracts. Shortening the time to submit this data will disproportionately increase the costs of providing this data. 1355.43 Out of home care data file elements. The out of home care data file proposed in this NPRM represents a significant expansion in the amount and type of information that states will be required to collect. While it is true that much of this information is available in case narratives and in other reports that are typically part of the child\u2019s case record the information is not in a format that is extractable as individual data fields. The entry of this information into data base fields that can then be extracted will in effect be causing workers to do double entry of the information as they will have to include it in their case notes or in scanned copies of documents (as we continue to strive for an electronic case file) and to also entered it into fields that can be used to provide this information in the AFCARS extracts. Although longitudinal data collection is a priority and Iowa recognizes its importance, it is unclear how many of the proposed elements would ensure positive outcomes and would represent quality data. We are further concerned by the expansion in the number and type of data elements to be reported. The responsibility for collection and entry of these elements will fall on the line staff who are responsible for seeing the children and families, case management, efforts to re-unify, reports to the court and many other day to day tasks essential to successful child welfare outcomes. We feel 1305 E WALNUT STREET \u2013 DES MOINES, IA 50319-0114 that it is essential that any additional data entry burdens be weighed with the trade off between seeing families and children and administrative tasks, such as data entry in mind. Concerns about specific data elements include: Family record number: Contrary to your statement in the NPRM, Iowa does not use a family number in the SACWIS system. Attempts to define the family have thus far proved to be difficult as families can take many different forms. The NPRM lacks a definition of family. Without a clear definition of family, this number will not be able to provide a valid basis for analysis of the data as each state is likely to arrive at a different definition of family. Even if a clear definition of family is provided, it is highly unlikely it will align with state definitions used for service eligibility and provision. This places an additional burden on staff who will have to differentiate between conflicting definitions. It may also cause staff to make duplicate entries into the SACWIS for service provision and AFCARS reporting, increasing the potential for inaccurate data. Child\u2019s Language and Languages used: The determination of a child\u2019s language is subjective and open to different interpretations. Unless the evaluation of language skills is done by a qualified professional according to a well defined set of criteria, the variability in this information is likely to render it useless in any analysis of child outcomes. Further, the list of languages included in the NPRM is far from a comprehensive set of languages that are likely to be encountered even in a mostly homogeneous state like Iowa. There was also no \u201cother\u201d category mentioned. How should states report on other languages that may be in use? There are better ways to estimate the need for interpreters in child welfare and the potential contribution to any measure of outcomes appears to be tenuous at best. Educational performance: We agree that grade level performance is an important element related to child well being, however, it is unclear how the number of repeated grades relates to grade level performance. It would seem more appropriate to collect information on whether the child is performing at grade level rather than the number of grades that were repeated. This would also allow for reporting of situations where a child is performing better than their peers. As proposed repeated grades seems to be a poor proxy for grade level performance as it only reflects the negative aspects of educational performance. Minor Parent: Collecting reliable information on fathers will be problematic and is likely to result in an under reporting of this information which will make this a biased measure at best. Given that situation, Iowa questions the usefulness of this information in measuring child outcomes. Mother Married at time of Child\u2019s birth: Iowa is concerned that reporting on this item alone represents a one sided view of the issues surrounding family status by ignoring the father\u2019s role and perpetuating the discriminatory view and the implied social stigma associated with single mothers. Fathers share equal responsibility for raising children, by only reporting on the mothers marital status this element negates the father\u2019s responsibility and places an undue burden for child well being solely on the mother. Household composition at time of removal: Iowa is concerned with the requirements for household composition at time of removal. It appears this requirement would not be the same as the household 1305 E WALNUT STREET \u2013 DES MOINES, IA 50319-0114 composition used for determination of IVE eligibility which would mean duplication of entry. The duplication of entry could prove to be a issue for a state trying to gain approval as a SACWIS compliant system. Child and family circumstances at removal / Circumstances at initial permanency plan / Annual circumstances: Iowa recognizes that the circumstances of a child and family are important factors to consider when developing a plan for meeting their needs. The requirement that these elements all be reported on a consistent basis appears to be an attempt to mandate that a national assessment tool that will remove the option for states to develop their own tools to meet specific needs in their communities and goes beyond the scope of titles IV-B and IV-E. 1355.44. Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Subsidy data file elements. Iowa supports not imposing penalties for the adoption and guardianship data file submissions. Iowa is, however, concerned about the requirement to report on all adoptions and guardianships for the entire term of the adoption assistance or guardianship subsidy agreement. Given that the state is no longer responsible for these children and the fact that the information to be reported will not change from reporting period to reporting period, it would seem sufficient to report a child only once when the adoption or guardianship is finalized. 1355.45 Compliance Iowa understands the need for accuracy in the reporting of data in the AFCARS files. Overall the approach outlined in the compliance section is sound. Iowa is also concerned about some of the requirements that will subject the state to penalties. The 100% reporting requirement for selected demographic information for example is setting up a criteria that is impossible for states to meet. Iowa would suggest that a 95% or 99% threshold would be a more reasonable expectation. Iowa feels that the costs involved in obtaining that last 1% to 5% will far out weigh any benefit that is gained by the additional information that would be provided. The tardy transactions requirement is another one that raises some concern as these are non recoverable errors for any given record. Once a record is flagged as tardy it can never be corrected and will also be counted as an error in subsequent submittals leading to a situation where the state can be penalized over and over for the same mistake. 1355..46 Penalties According to the NPRM there is no grace period for states to implement the changes needed to submit the new data elements before penalties would be assessed. The requirements for changes to Iowa\u2019s SACWIS system, changes in practice, training for staff and development of quality assurance protocols to insure we meet the data quality requirements are significant. It is difficult to develop an estimate of these costs at this time because so many of the details of the compliance checks are not included in the NPRM, but it is likely to take a minimum of two years to plan and implement the changes required by this proposed rule. Although difficult to estimate, the costs of implementing this rule are significant enough that absorbing them in a budget year will have a negative impact on the state\u2019s ability to provide services. Iowa would need time to incorporate the costs into a new budget request to the legislature to minimize any negative impacts caused by the need to divert funding from 1305 E WALNUT STREET \u2013 DES MOINES, IA 50319-0114 other programs. Depending on when a final rule is released, relative to Iowa\u2019s legislative session, it could take 6 to 18 months to seek additional funding to start the process of coming into compliance. Iowa also objects to the proposed penalty structure. The current structure imposes the same penalty on a state that has one error as that of a state with several errors. This is not a system that motivates improvement as the proposed penalty remains the same regardless of the magnitude of error. Penalties should be commensurate with the degree of error to allow incremental improvements, and an incentive program for states should be considered. ACF states that the \u201claw requires that we assure that the data submitted to us is reliable and consistent and authorizes us to utilize appropriate requirements and incentives to ensure that the system functions reliably\u201d. According to this statement, there is flexibility for ACF to alter the penalty structure and implement an incentive policy.

    "comment": "March 10, 2008 Kathleen McHugh Director, Division of Policy, Children\u2019s Bureau Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW., Suite 800 Washington, DC 20024. Dear Ms. McHugh: We write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rule Making that was published in the Federal Register on January 11, 2008. We strongly support the intent of the proposed changes to expand the AFCARS reporting population to include more children placed out of their homes. Their various reasons for placement out of their homes are extremely important context. An ability to distinguish those children in foster and out-of-home care due to maltreatment from those in foster and out-of-home care for other reasons is extremely important. Comment 1: Since the entire foster care population must be included in the AFCARS reporting population (see comment 2 below), We suggest that the AFCARS reporting population be characterized as those children \\\"in foster or out-of-home care\\\" rather than simply \\\"out-of-home care\\\". Since foster care can include children living at home, we are unable to devise a less awkward characterization. Comment 2: The trial home visit living arrangement response option (pp 2086, 2102, and 2121) should not be eliminated. It appears to us, and all others with whom we have consulted, that this particular change will narrow the AFCARS reporting population to a subset of the foster care population. It will transform AFCARS from a foster care reporting system to an out-of-home care reporting system. AFCARS will then be unable to meet a fundamental requirement -- reporting a count of children in foster care. Courts and agencies will continue to place children in trial home visits prior to transfers of legal custody as they do now. At least one state reports 30-40% of its foster children in trial home visits. Children in these placements are not in \\\"after-care.\\\" They are in foster care. State agencies and Courts recognize it as such, because the State agency retains placement and care responsibility in trial home visits. We have posed this question to about two-dozen judges and attorneys: Are children on trial home visit in foster care? So far, the unanimous answer is yes. We believe that until a court discharges the state agency of placement and care responsibility, these children remain in foster care. When the State agency can move a child between trial home visit and out-of-home placement without Court action, then we believe the agency continues to have placement and care responsibility. When a state agency places a child for whom the State retains legal custody with a non-relative, relative, or parent it does not shed placement and care responsibility, no matter the living arrangement. If children in trial home visits are in foster care, and an exit option is selected in lieu of the trial home visit response option, AFCARS will not contain records for http://FosteringCourtImprovement.org/ all children in foster care. AFCARS will then fail to serve its Congressional mandate to provide a count of children in foster care. We also point out that, in key legal respects, the \\\"Pre-adoptive home\\\" foster family home type, which is included in the proposed rule, is no different from a trial home visit. The pre-adoptive family does not have, but expects to receive, legal custody of the child following a Court action. The trial home visit family also does not have, but expects to receive, legal custody of the child following a Court action. Trial home visits are considered by some to be a model practice. Courts and agencies tell us that they use, and will continue to use, the trial home visit as a tool to transition children to reunification. Some state funding structures limit the provision of some services to only children in State custody. Some courts and agencies believe that keeping legal custody and placement and care responsibility with the agency during a trial period at home prior to reunification enhances permanency as measured by reduced rates of recurrence and reentry to foster care. Model practice or not, AFCARS reporting should accommodate this practice. By recognizing trial home visits as a valid living arrangement response option, we provide for the recording of the start date of the trial home visit. The length of a child's stay in out-of-home care is then the number of days from removal to start of the trial home visit. This simple calculation, being used today in the CFSR measures, avoids distortion of a child's length of stay in out-of-home care, while also providing for the measurement of that same child's length of stay in foster care. As long as AFCARS continues to record dates for both the start of the trial home visit and the discharge to reunification, then we will have some data to indicate when \\\"State courts do not discharge a State's placement and care responsibility routinely, or in a timely fashion\\\" (p 2086). If the time between those dates is exceptionally long in a particular jurisdiction, that could prompt action to identify the problem. Exceptionally long times from start of trial home visit to reunification could result from many causes. They could be the result of reasonable differences of opinion between the agency and the Court, in which case we should avoid an assumption that, in some sense, the Court's opinion is incorrect. They could result from an overburdened court. They could result from an overburdened agency attorney. If the proposed change to the reporting population is enacted, we will lose valuable information in these cases that could lead us to important improvements to our systems. To improve upon the current reporting, we suggest addition of \\\"Date of petition for exit\\\" element in the \\\"General exit information\\\" category on page 2124. Not all exits from foster care (if that is what the child is exiting...?) will require a petition to a court, but we believe that nearly all will. This addition would provide data to more directly measure effects due to Court delays. We suggest addition of a \\\"Parent\\\" or \\\"Home\\\" response option under the living arrangement category \\\"Other living arrangement type\\\" element (p 2121). This terminology provides a neutral characterization of the intent of the living arrangement, as the other response options do. This better serves the pure reporting intent of AFCARS, capturing just the aspect of the living arrangement that is important from the child's perspective. http://FosteringCourtImprovement.org/ Comment 3: We suggest addition of an \\\"Other\\\" response option under the living arrangement category \\\"Other living arrangement type\\\" element (p 2121). Many states place children in unlicensed, unpaid homes. A child placed with a neighbor, fictive kin, or relative may not be in a \\\"foster family home\\\" according to State law or agency rule. Add such an uninformative, catch-all option, is unfortunate, but we fear there are a great many living arrangements that are not covered by the proposed options, and we appreciate the need to avoid the confusion that a full delineation of options would bring. Comment 4: There is a typo on page 2120. The element \\\"Termination of parental rights -- second parent\\\" is listed twice on that page. The first instance should be corrected to \\\"Termination of parental rights -- first parent.\\\" Comment 5: The \\\"Number of siblings placed together\\\" element on page 2121 would have greater utility if we also had a \\\"Number of siblings in foster or out of home care\\\" element. Comment 6: The provision for the \\\"Runaway\\\" response option in the \\\"Exit reason\\\" element on page 2124 is problematic. We challenge anyone to find a way in which this exit reason is in a child's interest. If a reason for exit is never in the child's interest, it probably should never happen, but that does not mean we should not record it. Unfortunately, children do exit foster care due to unintended events and oversights, such as clerical errors and lapsed orders. These reasons for exit are also not in the child's interest, but they have the same explanatory value as \\\"Runaway\\\". We do not suggest that these options be provided. The key similarity among these exits is that they are unintentional. We suggest replacing \\\"Runaway\\\" with an \\\"Other\\\" or \\\"Unintentional\\\" response option for this element, providing there is technical guidance that only unintended exits will carry the \\\"Other\\\" reason. Thank you for all of the hard work and thought that went into this proposed rule.

    "comment": "March 11, 2008 Kathleen McHugh, Director Division of Policy/CB/ACYF/ACF 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20024 Dear Ms. McHugh, Thank you for allowing States the opportunity to provide input regarding the proposed rule for the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting Systems (AFCARS) described in the Federal Register of January 11, 2008. Please be assured that Nebraska shares the Administration for Children and Families commitment to producing reliable longitudinal data for the child welfare system. We are happy to see that ACF is moving in this direction, however, we do have concerns that this regulation places a significant burden on states without providing additional funding and support. The penalty structure outlined in the NRPM does not allow flexibility in implementing the complex and vast changes proposed. In addition, the shortened time frame for states to submit data makes it very difficult to meet the proposed 100 percent accuracy benchmarks without the data being compromised by staff needing to meet statistical requirements. Part 1: General Comments Nebraska believes that gathering and evaluating information related to youth in out-of-home care will enable us to improve in the timely achievement of permanency, ensuring child safety and enhancing child well-being. The enhancement of data collection that provides additional supporting data, improves consistency and comparability of data among states is a laudable goal, but this also causes us some concerns which will be addressed throughout our response. We also like the idea of moving some of the adoption elements to the foster care file and having the adoptive file become a subsidiary file on adoption and guardianship. First, we believe that the full costs and burden of implementing the proposed changes are underestimated. Nebraska will incur significant costs and impacts on resources. Part 2 of this response describes these costs in more detail. It is also unclear how increased costs for ongoing data collection and increased case worker burden will be funded. We strongly recommend that the Children\u2019s Bureau identify new funding to cover the costs of this new federal requirement. Part 3 of this response describes these concerns and recommendations in more detail. Second, we are concerned that many of the proposed additional data components are not supportive of a SACWIS system and are being proposed to bring statistical integrity to the AFCARS data. This is a commendable goal, but many of the additional data requirements are not data elements that are a natural component of a SACWIS case management data system. Many of the data elements would require case management workers to have very specific and detailed knowledge of the AFCARS definitions on when and how to enter information. It appears that the proposed rules are not supportive of doing good case work or implementing best Helping People Live Better Lives An Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer printed with soy ink on recycled paper practice, but of spending time entering data elements for statistical purposes. No matter how hard we try, raw data cannot report on the quality of the work being completed. Third, there are no timeframes outlined in the proposed rules in relation to the length of time a state has to implement any of the changes. Any length of time less than a one-year implementation time frame is too short. Nebraska may not be able to complete all the work required to develop specifications and systems and collect and report data within 12 months without foregoing other initiatives related to SACWIS, CFS Reviews or other initiatives deemed vital in the current state of the state. Part 2: Enhancing the Quality, Usefulness, and Clarity of the Information Timely Submission \u2013 Section 1355.45(c)(1): Nebraska disagrees with shortening the length of time to submit the AFCARS files from 45 calendar days to 15 calendar days. States should be afforded ample opportunity to rectify their data prior to officially submitting the data to the Children\u2019s Bureau. At that point, if a State is out of compliance, the proposed rules on improving the data quality, missing data etcetera and possible financial penalties could be in place. Reporting Population - Section 1355.41: Nebraska has major concerns that directly tie to Section 1355.43(d)(1) Date of Child\u2019s Removal from Home. The proposed change \u2018to report the date the child is reunified and the state maintains custody as a child\u2019s exit from foster care\u201d is not supported by the policies that govern IV-E determination. This change would have a major impact on Nebraska and the IV-E Eligibility Determination System. This system is automated within our SACWIS system which is where our AFCARS data is gathered. The Date of Removal is critical to IV-E eligibility determination and to make this change without making similar changes to the IV-E policy is not good or consistent rulemaking. Family Record Number, Section 1355.43 (a)(5): This information is an area of concern. Nebraska\u2019s current data system creates a record number, but family situations are fluid. People get divorced, remarried, live together, move in with other family members, etc. all of which could cause a new family record to be generated. We are concerned that states could be penalized because computer systems are not as fluid as families. Child Demographic Information - In Section 1355.43(b) ACF is proposing changes that impact demographic information. This poses problems in Nebraska because we have a shared data system that includes over 33 Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services programs. A change to any type of data collection related to a person affects all programs, not just one. Requiring the States to add a Race of \u2018Abandoned\u2019, may not be approved or needed by the other programs. This example and others show that these proposed changes impact policy and practice. Nebraska does not believe that a reporting mechanism should impact the methods or time frames that impact case work policies and practices. Another example is the requirement to provide the child\u2019s actual or estimated date of birth. This requirement is in conflict with existing Nebraska policies of what to enter as a birth date when we have been unable to ascertain the information. Child Language- In Sections 1355.43(b)(5), (i) and (ii), Nebraska does not believe that collecting data as to whether a child is verbal, pre-verbal or non-verbal is relevant. This is information that would need to be continuously updated in the case of a small child that remains in out of home care over time and it is not information that supports a case worker in the day to day work environment. We support capturing languages used by the child and family but believe that 2 other data elements would provide information on youth who are either pre-verbal or have some kind of physical or mental health issue that would indicate that they are non-verbal. This holds true for spoken languages. Languages used and language preferred, while they may be of interest to researchers, do not belong in AFCARS. What matters is that the child is placed in a home where he/she is comfortable and can communicate with his/her caretakers and that the state has an adequate supply of foster homes to meet the needs of the children needing placements. We believe an element capturing whether English is not the child\u2019s primary language would suffice and if it is not completed by the worker, we would assume that the child spoke English. Immunizations - The proposed changes for Section 1355.43(b)(7) require a check of a box to indicate if a child is up to date on his/her immunizations. This is one example of many proposed data element changes that would require staff to complete data entry of information contained in the physical case file. In order to be of benefit to case workers, a well thought out information system would have logic as to the Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule and as the information is entered the correct AFCARS element would be counted for that child and the information could be automatically printed on the child\u2019s case plan/court report. The AFCARS requirement is all about something existing or not and is not supportive of the case work process and data that would be helpful to the on-going case manager. Education - Section 1355.43(b)(8) on education performance and requiring workers to track the number of times a youth repeated a grade as being an adequate indicator of educational performance for youth in out of home care is of concern. The Federal Register states that grade level performance may be an appropriate indicator of educational performance as it is used consistently across the country. The problem with this indicator is not that youth are not performing and therefore have to repeat a grade; it is because schools may not allow the transfer of credit hours which then causes the youth to repeat grades and this information is not captured. Educational performance related to capturing AFCARS data should be about children being enrolled in school and the number of different schools attended. In regard to Section 1355.43(b)(9) \u2013 Special Education, ACF is trying to capture quality information in a quantifiable format which is not a good way to ensure data quality or integrity. There are some things that need to be reviewed and judged by examining a case record and conducting interviews with concerned parties and not captured as data elements. Minor Parent - Section 1355.43(b)(12) and Section 1355.43(e)(9) Minor parent and number of children living with minor parent. Nebraska understands the need to know the number of adolescents that are parents, but disagrees with the logic that you will be able to determine the extent to which those young people are responsible for the care of their children. The premise that unless the minor parent and youth are residing in the same location AND the placement is not a foster home, is the only criteria that would indicate youth responsibilities to the infant child is narrow in thought. Minor parents residing in more restrictive placements may be making decisions, having regular daily contact and maintaining responsibility for the infant that will not be captured with the proposed data elements. This logic also excludes non-custodial or minor parents who share custody who may have very liberal contact and decision making responsibility for their child. Termination of Parental Rights - In Sections 1355.43(c)(4) through (c)(7) you are asking for TPR data, but nowhere in the Federal Register do you require gathering information related to \u2018Compelling Reasons\u2019 not to pursue TPR. This information would be beneficial in furthering the examination of timeliness to permanency. We would recommend that this information be gathered and reported. 3 Removal Transaction Date \u2013 Nebraska has concerns related to Section 1355.43 (d)(2) the proposed rule requiring \u201cRemovals\u201d be documented within 15 days of the child\u2019s removal from his/her parent. Nebraska does not disagree on setting a time frame. However, 15 days does not allow case workers time to properly conduct a safety assessment to determine if the child is safe or unsafe and identify the reasons the child cannot be safely maintained in the home. Therefore, the subsequent information the ACF wants reported in (d)(3) \u2013 (d)(7) may be inaccurate. Thirty days would seem to be a standard that States could reasonably achieve. Removal Circumstances \u2013 Section 1355.43(d)(7), we believe you should eliminate the selection of \u2018Child Behavior Problem\u2019. We acknowledge that the proposal is changing the definition to capture only those situations when a parent is unable to manage the child\u2019s behavior but there has been no involvement by the juvenile justice system. We believe that these circumstances should not be captured in terms of the child except as the behavior relates to a mental illness of a child but, rather, in terms of parental capacity related to areas such as parenting knowledge, skills, abilities or motivation to parent. Date of Living Arrangement \u2013 Section 1355.43(e)(1) \u2013 refer to our comments on the Reporting Population related to the proposed change on reporting children in state custody residing at home as an \u2018Exit\u2019. Living Arrangement \u2013 Section 1355.43(e)(3) \u2013 it is unclear in the Register how a state would report a child residing in home that is not licensed and a non-relative. Nebraska allows this for homes where the family is known to the child, such as placement of the child with a close family friend. Also, there is no reference in the materials that capture youth being placed with Tribal foster families. In Section 1355.43(e)(4), we would require additional definitions of the various Group Home selections and other response options. The descriptions in the Federal Register are too generic and we are unable to determine which levels of care would be the appropriate response. We are also unclear as to the type of living arrangement to be selected if a youth is residing in his/her own apartment pending case closure. Foster Parent(s) relationship to the Child \u2013 Section 1355.43(e)(11): We believe that knowing a relative is fostering is sufficient information and that the specific type of relationship is an additional unnecessary workload effort for staff. Amount of Payment \u2013 In Section 1355.43(e)(21): The State would disagree that it is less of a burden to report the amount of payment only if it is IV-E. It is much easier to report on all rather than on a subset. We would like the reporting of this data element to remain unchanged. Permanency Plan - In Section 1355.43(f)(1) the State questions why ACF would propose adding additional case plan goals of guardianship (relative and non-relative), when you will eventually deduct the information when the child is placed with a relative or non-relative and the exit reason is guardianship. Concurrent Planning \u2013 Section 1355.43(f)(3): Nebraska likes the idea of trying to capture information related to concurrent planning, but does not agree with the logic described in this section. The proposal is assuming that a quality issue can be captured by a check of a box. You can identify if a Concurrent Plan exists or not as described in Section 1355.43(f)(3)(i), but you cannot determine that a plan has been fully developed. We recommend that you eliminate this data element. 4 Juvenile Justice Involvement \u2013 Section 1355.43(f)(5): Nebraska would like additional clarification related to reporting this information for each alleged or adjudicated delinquency or status offense during each six-month report period. It is unclear if we would report a youth met the criteria in July (which we would report for the period ending September 30) and the youth remains in out-of-home care during the next reporting period, if we would continue to report this youth as having Juvenile Justice involvement in the March 30 report. Please clarify. Circumstances at Initial Permanency Plan and Annual Circumstances and Circumstances at exit from foster care: Sections 1355.43.(f)(6), (7) and 1355.43(g)(6) are of significant concern to Nebraska. The response options provided are not related to \u2018change\u2019 factors that need to occur in order for Permanency to be achieved. These sections should be capturing the \u2018Diminished Personal and Parental Protective Capacities\u2019 that must change in order for the child to be reunited or another permanency plan put into place. The Diminished Protective Capacities are behavioral, cognitive and emotional characteristics that can specifically and directly be associated with a person taking action to ensure the child\u2019s safety. A protective capacity is a specific quality that can be observed, understood and demonstrated as part of the way a parent thinks feels and acts and results in protective behavior. Protective capacities may be enhanced (adequate or above) or diminished (deficient). Nebraska would be happy to share the finite list of Protective Capacities developed by ACTION for the Protection of Children and used in the Nebraska Safety Intervention System. General Exit Information - Section 1355.43(g) \u2013 Nebraska again refers you to the Reporting population and the fact that we disagree with the proposed definition that a child placed with a parent while remaining in State custody should be defined as an Exit. Death due to abuse/neglect in care \u2013 Section 1355.43(g)(4): The State believes that this reporting requirement is duplicative. We would report this information in NCANDS. We believe that no changes should be made. Part 3: Costs and Estimate of Burden Nebraska strongly disagrees with the determination that \u201cthe costs to the States as a result of this rule will be minor\u201d and believes that the burden estimated in the Federal Register is unrealistically low. Nebraska may not incur significant financial costs to implement the proposed rule which means changing and enhancing an existing information system, but the cost to the field in delaying other technological initiatives that front line workers have identified as essential to improving their case management and achieving better outcomes will be a high price to pay in addition to the financial costs to implement the specified changes. Part 4: Funding Nebraska has a SACWIS system and therefore allowable costs for system changes may be reimbursed up to 50 percent. This option covers only partial costs that meet certain conditions. Also, because we do not know the time period that will be allowed for implementation, we may have to pay for additional development resources as the current capacity cannot absorb the work without sacrificing other projects. There is no discussion in the Federal Register that recognizes that states will incur costs to train workers to collect AFCARS information. The proposed funding options address only the cost of changes to States\u2019 information systems. 5 Nebraska recommends that the Children\u2019s Bureau identify additional funding to cover the full costs of the proposed new federal requirements. Without additional funding, the proposed requirements will and should be considered an unfunded mandate. Part 5: Proposed Implementation and Reporting Time Frames There are no proposed implementation timeframes identified in the Federal Register. ACF should allow states time to comment on any proposed timeframes for implementation and reporting. Nebraska would not consider a one-year implementation period to be realistic given the level of effort associated with computer system changes and the limited resources and staff support in the technology centers. Nebraska runs their computer upgrades on a quarterly basis and enhancements and changes to current functionality are already slated 6 months to 1 year in advance. Once the AFCARS requirements are finalized, the design, development, testing and implementation work would follow. Again, in order to meet the one year time frame we would need to focus only on this initiative which would cause delays in other initiatives beneficial to the state. Given these considerations, Nebraska proposes that states be given up to three years to fully implement AFCARS changes with the condition that they submit a plan setting benchmarks to be completed in each year of development that results in meeting all reporting requirements no later than the end of the third year. ACF could consider whether those states that could submit data sooner, should do so. Regarding the submission time frame, we recommend that the AFCARS be reported annually rather than semi-annually. An annual reporting period avoids the complications of creating an annual file from two six-month files and simplifies the calculation of outcomes and penalties. We thank the Children\u2019s Bureau for the opportunity to comment and we look forward to further collaboration between the Children\u2019s Bureau, State child welfare agencies and national organizations as we work to improve outcomes for children. Sincerely, Todd A. Landry, Director Division of Children and Family Services Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services 6",
